<h1>THE BOY FROM GREEN GINGER LAND</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THREE CHILDREN AND A DOG</span></h2>

<p>‘Emmeline, it’s your turn to choose a game
to-day. What story shall we do?’</p>

<p>‘No, Micky; it’s your turn,’ put in his twin
sister Kitty. ‘Emmeline chose the day before
yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘I know it’s my turn really, Kitty, but gentlemen
always let ladies choose,’ said eight-year-old
Micky with dignity. ‘I’d very much <em>advise</em>
“Swiss Family Robinson,” because it seems such
a splendid opportunity, now the curtain-rods
are down, to use the short ones as sugar-canes;
and Mary’s so sorry we’re going away to-morrow
that she won’t be cross even if the paint does
get a little kicked off the bath when it’s being
wrecked.’</p>

<p>‘Micky, I think it’s horrid of you to talk of
Mary’s being sorry like that,’ said Emmeline—‘just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as if you didn’t care a bit about our
having to leave the home of a lifetime, and the
only real friend who has been with us since we
were babies, to go and live with an aunt who
doesn’t care for us!’</p>

<p>‘How do you know Aunt Grace doesn’t care
for us? She’s always very jolly when she
comes here, and she never forgets birthdays,’
said Micky, who had a sense of justice. ‘She
sends such sensible things, too—postal orders, or
steam-engines that really work, or real good
books of adventure. <em>She</em> never gives you poetry-books.’
This last was a sore point with Micky just
then, for his godmother had recently presented
him with a gilt-edged volume of ‘The Poetical
Works of William Wordsworth,’ for which he had
been expected to write a laborious round-hand
letter of thanks.</p>

<p>‘Presents are all very well, but they don’t
prove that a person loves you,’ said Emmeline;
‘and as to her being jolly when she comes here,
she never stays more than a day or two at a
time, and always seems in a great hurry to get
back to London again. Do you think, if she
had really cared anything about us, she would
have left us a whole year after darling mother
died before offering to come and look after us?’</p>

<p>This was rather out of Micky’s depth, so he
prudently changed the subject. ‘Well, let’s get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
started with the game,’ he said, ‘else we shall
have to get tidy for tea before we’ve even been
properly wrecked.’</p>

<p>But Emmeline was not to be put off so easily.
‘Micky,’ she demanded solemnly, ‘how can you
be so taken up with story-games when we’re as
good as <em>living</em> a story ourselves?’</p>

<p>The twins’ eyes sparkled. Anything savouring
of romance was as the breath of life to them,
and Emmeline was really rather impressive when
she talked in that grave way.</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’ asked Kitty, eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Why, what I have just been saying,’ replied
Emmeline. ‘Here are we, three orphans, left
to the care of a worldly aunt——’</p>

<p>‘But are you quite sure she’s worldly?’ asked
Kitty, looking alarmed. Kitty was not altogether
clear what ‘worldly’ meant, but from the
way Emmeline pronounced the word it sounded
like something very bad.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid so,’ said Emmeline. ‘I remember
once, when mother and I spent a night with
her in London, and she and her friend kept talking
about a ball they had just been to.’</p>

<p>‘But balls aren’t wrong, are they?’ asked
Kitty. Emmeline was twelve, and Kitty regarded
as a great authority on all questions of
morals.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that they’re exactly wrong,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
acknowledged Emmeline, ‘but they are a great waste
of time. When I’m grown up I never mean to go
to them, but shall spend all my time working for
the poor. Besides, it isn’t only her going to
balls that makes me think Aunt Grace worldly,
but the way she dresses and—everything. I
quite expect that when we know more of her we
shall find her just like one of the fine ladies
one reads of in books.’</p>

<p>‘Will she be cruel to us, do you suppose?’
asked Kitty with zest. She did not really
believe that merry, good-natured Aunt Grace
could be cruel, any more than she really, at the
bottom of her heart, believed in a romance of
Micky’s about a certain blood-thirsty burglar
who lived in the spare-room wardrobe, but it
made life more exciting to pretend to herself
that she did.</p>

<p>‘Of course not. What a silly question,
Kitty!’ exclaimed Emmeline impatiently. ‘I
dare say she will be too busy with parties and so
on to bother herself much about us, but she’ll
be quite kind—at least, to us. Punch is the
only one I feel at all doubtful about.’ She flung
herself down on to the hearthrug, and rested
her head against that of a fox-terrier who was
lying there half asleep, and who gave a little
growl of remonstrance at being disturbed. ‘We
hadn’t got him when she was here last, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
see, so we can’t tell what she’ll think of him.
I shouldn’t a bit wonder if she didn’t let us bring
him to Woodsleigh, or even if she does, she’ll
keep him chained up all day, poor darling!
People who think much about clothes never do
like dogs, except just silly little toy things.’</p>

<p>Micky and Kitty broke out together in a chorus
of indignation and horror.</p>

<p>‘If they are so horrid as to chain Punch
up in the kennel all day I shall jolly well stay
out with him and keep him company!’ shouted
Micky.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Emmeline, you don’t really think there’s
any danger of Aunt Grace not letting darling
Punch come?’ said Kitty, almost in tears.</p>

<p>‘Well, I hope not,’ said Emmeline; ‘anyhow
I’ve written to her about it, so till we’ve had time
to get her answer there’s no use worrying any
more.’ There was not, but the very suggestion
that Punch might have to be left behind had
cast a gloom upon the party—a gloom which did
not altogether lift even when the brilliant idea
struck Micky that the brooms in the housemaid’s
cupboard, if placed upside down and balanced
against the wall, would make excellent palm-trees
for the Robinsons’ desert island.</p>

<p>On the whole, Emmeline was the happiest of
the three just then, for, grieved as she was at
leaving Mary and possibly Punch, the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of going to live with her aunt was not altogether
without its secret charm for her. The good
little girl who had such a beautiful influence on
her worldly relations played a prominent part
in several of her favourite books, and it was that
part which Emmeline pictured herself playing
with regard to Aunt Grace. She would have
been ashamed to express this idea in so many
words even to herself, far more to the twins, but it
none the less reconciled her a good deal to the
new life which lay before them.</p>

<p>Emmeline Bolton had always been a child of
the type whose virtue specially appeals to nurses.
All the grown-up people, indeed, who had ever
been brought much into contact with her agreed in
considering her a very good girl. In some respects
she deserved their favourable opinion, for she was
truthful, obedient, and conscientious by nature,
but perhaps the fact that she had never been very
strong had more to do with her reputation for
goodness than she herself or anyone else quite
realised.</p>

<p>The child lived in an atmosphere of warm
and constant approval which was not altogether
wholesome. Such had been the state of affairs
two years ago, when all three children had
fallen ill of measles. Micky and Kitty had had
the disease lightly, but with Emmeline it took a
serious form. For two days and nights she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
lain delirious, and there came a moment when
Mary, believing her to be unconscious, had sobbed
out to the trained nurse: ‘I always had a feeling
that the dear child was too sweet and good to be
long for this world!’</p>

<p>This presentiment proved a groundless one.
As Emmeline grew better the words which she
had heard in her half-delirious state came back to
her, and she dwelt on them constantly. Just at
first they frightened her a little, but when she had
become quite strong and well again she ceased to
be alarmed, and only felt pleasantly elated at being
too good to be long for this world. It almost—though
not quite—made up for having straight
brown hair and a pale peaked face instead of
golden curls and glowing cheeks like the twins,
who were so pretty that people in the street sometimes
turned round to look after them.</p>

<p>If Emmeline’s mother had lived she would
probably have perceived that the child was in
grave danger of growing into a little Pharisee, and
she might have done something to check it, but
she had become very ill almost as soon as the
children had recovered from the measles, and had
died less than a year later. After her death the
children had gone on living at the old home at
Eastwich, a great East Anglian town, under the
joint charge of Mary and Miss Rogers, their daily
governess. The arrangement was never intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to be more than a temporary one, for their aunt,
Miss Bolton, who was also their guardian, wished
them to go and live with her at Woodsleigh, a
place some twelve miles distant from Eastwich,
as soon as she regained possession of a cottage
there, which had been left her by her father, but
let for several years past. Mary was to go to
her own home to keep house for a brother,
so that to-morrow, when her children, as she
always called them, went to begin their new life
with Aunt Grace, she would have to be left behind
at Eastwich.</p>

<p>‘Come, my darlings,’ said Mary, landing so
abruptly on the Swiss Family Robinson’s desert
island that most of the palm-trees were knocked
over, ‘tea’s quite ready, and there’s buttered toast
and coffee.’</p>

<p>Buttered toast and coffee were always regarded
as special treats, but somehow to-day nobody
seemed to have quite as much appetite for them
as usual. Mary and Micky kept making jokes,
and they all tried to be very merry, but not even
the presence of Punch, who was allowed to sit on
a chair between the twins in special honour of the
occasion, made the festivity much of a success.
They could none of them forget it was the last tea
with Mary in the old home.</p>

<p>Emmeline stayed up that evening until some
time after the twins had gone to bed, and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
on the floor leaning her head against Mary’s
knee.</p>

<p>‘Well, my darling,’ said Mary after a while, ‘I
hope you’ll all be very happy and good with your
Aunt Grace. Of course some of her ways may
be a bit different from what you’re used to, but
there, I’m sure she’s as well-meaning a young lady
as ever breathed, and we know that everything
must work out for the best, or it wouldn’t be let
happen. Well, I know you’ll always be a good
child, dear Miss Emmeline, and help Master
Micky and Miss Kitty, bless their dear little
hearts!’</p>

<p>Poor Mary! She would have been horrified if
she could have guessed that any words or tone of
hers could have led Emmeline to set Aunt Grace
down as worldly, for Mary was a thoroughly good
woman, but all unconsciously a little accent of
doubtfulness showed itself in her voice and confirmed
Emmeline’s impression.</p>

<p>For several years past the little girl had undressed
herself, but for this last time Mary put her
to bed just as she had done in the far-off days of
Emmeline’s dimmest memories.</p>

<p>Long after Mary had kissed her good-night the
child lay awake, thinking how dreary it would be
at Woodsleigh to have no old nurse to tuck her
up, and passionately resolving that, come what
might, she at least would always keep true to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
old ways Mary had taught her. She made the
resolution purely and simply out of loyalty to
Mary, and not with any view to her mission
towards Aunt Grace, which for the moment she
had quite forgotten.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">FIR-TREE COTTAGE</span></h2>

<p>To-morrow morning came all too soon. A pleasant
letter from Aunt Grace arrived at breakfast-time,
containing a warm invitation for Punch to take up
his abode at Woodsleigh, which was a great relief
and pleasure to the rest of the party, but otherwise
the day was a trying one. Mary went about
with a duster swathed round her head, as she
always did during the spring-cleaning, and there
was a general feeling of bustle and discomfort.
The children wandered restlessly from room to
room, trying to help, but usually only succeeded
in being in the way, and secretly they rather
longed for the cab which was to take them to the
station in time for the 11.35 train.</p>

<p>The cab came at last, and less than a quarter of
an hour later they found themselves installed with
Punch and endless baggage in a second-class
railway carriage, while Mary stood on the platform
smiling bravely. Another few minutes, and the
train was starting with a shriek and a pant. All
three children leaned out of the window, waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
frantically, till the line curved round a corner and
Mary and her fluttering handkerchief were lost to
sight. After that it was Punch who saved the
situation. All his journeys to the seaside had
failed to accustom him to railway travelling, and
he now took refuge under the seat, looking so
cowed and miserable that nobody could think of
anything but how to comfort and reassure him.
They were so much occupied with this as to be
quite taken by surprise at reaching their destination
in what seemed an astonishingly short time.</p>

<p>The only people waiting on Woodsleigh platform
were a lad who served both as porter and
ticket-collector and Aunt Grace herself—an Aunt
Grace who looked wonderfully young and pretty
to be aunt and guardian to such a big girl as
Emmeline. She was, in fact, very much what
her niece Kitty might become a few years
hence when transformed from a tomboy into a
fashionable, grown-up young lady. She hurried
forward to open the carriage door for the
children, and greeted the whole party, including
Punch, with such frank delight at seeing them that
not even Emmeline could help being charmed,
and a limpet-like twin was soon clinging to either
side of her in a devoted, if rather inconvenient,
fashion.</p>

<p>‘We shall have to leave the boxes to be brought
up by the milk-cart in the course of the afternoon,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
explained Aunt Grace when the luggage had all
been taken out of the train. ‘We’re very primitive
at Woodsleigh, and the milk-cart’s the only
thing we can boast of in the way of a public conveyance.
It won’t come till later on in the afternoon,
but I can lend brushes and sponges, so I hope
you’ll be able to manage all right till then.’</p>

<p>‘We did wash our hands just before coming,
and Mary brushed all our hairs,’ Micky was careful
to assure her, ‘so you needn’t trouble to lend
us things. But thank you all the same,’ he added
hastily, for fear of hurting her feelings.</p>

<p>‘Micky, you <em>know</em> Mary always makes us wash
our hands and faces after railway journeys!’ said
Emmeline—a remark which Micky, who was just
then stooping down to undo Punch’s lead, found
it convenient not to hear.</p>

<p>‘I hope before long to get a donkey and
donkey-cart of our own,’ observed Aunt Grace as
they left the station and came out into a village
street; ‘then we shan’t have to depend on the
milk-cart, and it will be much more convenient
altogether.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Aunt Grace, how lovely!’ exclaimed
Kitty, giving a joyous little skip. ‘Donkeys are
such dears!’</p>

<p>‘I shall ride ours bare-back,’ announced Micky,
‘and teach him all sorts of tricks.’</p>

<p>‘I’m always so glad to think of a donkey having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a good home,’ said Emmeline; ‘people are so
cruel to them sometimes. When we stayed at
the seaside, it often made us quite sad to see how
they were ill-treated.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘it is very
sad. Two or three years ago I was staying at
the seaside with some children, who made a
special point of hiring the ones with unkind
masters for extra long rides, and never letting
them be whipped, so as to give them a rest from
being ill-treated.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I knew those nice children,’ said Kitty.</p>

<p>‘And I expect they found the donkeys really
went quite as well, didn’t they, Aunt Grace?’
asked Emmeline, who had not yet learned that
virtue often has to be its own reward.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m afraid I can’t say they did,’ owned
Aunt Grace with a little twinkle in her eye; ‘at
the best of times they went at a slow and stately
pace somewhat resembling a funeral procession,
and at the worst of times they sat down comfortably
in the middle of the road and refused to
budge. Still, I don’t doubt that if my friends had
had the bringing up of those donkeys from the
first, they would have gone all right without being
beaten. It was simply that the poor creatures
had got so used to it that they didn’t understand
anything else.’</p>

<p>‘Aren’t we nearly at your house?’ asked Kitty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
presently; ‘we seem getting quite outside the
village now.’</p>

<p>‘No, we have still about ten minute’s walk
before we get to Fir-tree Cottage,’ replied Aunt
Grace; ‘it stands right away from other houses,
just outside a large wood. It’s very nice in most
ways being quite out of the village, for it makes
one so much freer to do just as one likes, but it’s
rather inconvenient sometimes being so far from
the station. It’s really not so very much farther to
Chudstone Station—the one you passed next before
Woodsleigh; indeed, when I have plenty of time,
I sometimes start from there instead of from
Woodsleigh, for it makes a delightful walk through
the wood.’</p>

<p>‘How jolly to live in a cottage and so near a
wood!’ cried Kitty, giving another little skip.</p>

<p>‘As to living in a cottage, I’m afraid you won’t
find it quite your idea of one,’ said Aunt Grace,
‘though it really <em>was</em> one before grandfather built
on the front part of the house. The wood’s real
enough though, and begins only just outside our
back-garden gate, which is very charming of it.’</p>

<p>‘I thought grandfather was a Professor,’ remarked
Micky, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>‘Why, so he was,’ said Aunt Grace.</p>

<p>‘But if he built the front part of the house
he must have been a stone-mason, like Mary’s
brother,’ objected Micky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace didn’t mean that he built it with
his own hands, you silly child!’ said Emmeline,
laughing.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t wonder Micky thought I did,’ said
Aunt Grace kindly; ‘it was very natural.’</p>

<p>Aunt Grace was right in saying that Fir-tree
Cottage was not the kind of cottage to which the
children were used. It was what they considered
quite a large house, standing well back from the
road among lawns and shrubberies, and when
they walked in at the front door they found themselves,
not in the poky little passage that Kitty
had been picturing to herself from her remembrances
of seaside lodgings, but in a hall as large
as the one at their old home, and far more charming,
for it was bright with ferns and flowering
plants and cosy with cushioned seats and lion-skin
rugs. In this hall they were met by a rather
austere-looking person whom Aunt Grace called
Jane.</p>

<p>‘Jane was my nurse when I was a little girl,’
she said, ‘so we are very old friends, and now she
is going to help look after you;’ at which Jane
smiled grimly, and Emmeline thought how horrid
it would be to have her to look after them instead
of kind, gentle Mary.</p>

<p>‘Now, we must certainly take Punch to be
introduced to Cook,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘she’s a
splendid person for animals.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>This introduction was so successful that Emmeline
forgot all disagreeable impressions. Cook
was found in her bright airy kitchen with its red-tiled
floor and rows of shining dish-covers, and
she and Punch seemed quite delighted with one
another. ‘That’s a rare nice little dog,’ she kept
saying as he smelt round her skirts with marked
approval. ‘Have you shown them the kennel,
miss?’ she added. ‘I give that a good scrubbing
yesterday as soon as ever I heard he was coming,
so that will be all nice and fresh for him now.
There’s clean straw in too.’</p>

<p>‘We must go and admire it,’ said Aunt Grace,
and they went through the scullery and out into
the back-yard, in one corner of which was an
enormous dog-kennel.</p>

<p>‘The last dog who lived here was a St. Bernard,’
explained Aunt Grace, ‘so Punch will find
his quarters very roomy ones.’</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace, you aren’t going to keep him
chained up except when he goes for walks, are
you?’ asked Kitty.</p>

<p>‘Why, of course not,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘this
is his private bedroom, that’s all, and I no more
expect him to stay here all day than I shall expect
<em>you</em> to stay in your bedrooms.’</p>

<p>This so greatly relieved the children that they
were in a mood to be delighted with everything
when Aunt Grace led them upstairs to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
them their own bedrooms. She took them first
to the room which the two girls were to share,
and they both exclaimed at the sight of its dainty
white-painted furniture and fresh muslin hangings.
In each half of the room was a little white
bed, a white wash-hand stand, and a white chest
of drawers with a looking-glass standing on the
top of it.</p>

<p>‘It’s quite like grand grown-up ladies, both of
us having a wash-stand and a dressing-table to
ourselves,’ said Kitty, with much satisfaction;
‘there was only one of each in the night-nursery
at home.’</p>

<p>‘They are such pretty ones, too,’ said Emmeline.
‘I do love white enamel.’</p>

<p>‘I’m very glad you like them,’ said Aunt Grace,
looking pleased; ‘I always think one has so much
more heart in keeping one’s room tidy if the
furniture’s nice.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you won’t have to leave your things
about here, Kitty,’ remarked Emmeline, in her
elder-sisterly way.</p>

<p>Kitty was not listening; she had rushed to the
window. ‘I do believe—yes, you really <em>can</em> just
see the sea!’ she exclaimed. ‘Oh, Aunt Grace,
may we go there every day?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid it’s rather too far off to go there
every day,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘it’s a good five
miles. Still, I hope we shall be able to go there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
quite often—at all events when we’ve got our
donkey-cart.’</p>

<p>There was a door between the girls’ room and
the next, which Aunt Grace pointed out to them.
‘My room is the next,’ she said, ‘so you’ll be
able to run in for any help you want. Jane will
come in and do your hair in the mornings, but of
course she won’t always be there for the odds
and ends of things that need doing.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve done my own hair for quite a long time,’
Emmeline was careful to inform her.</p>

<p>Aunt Grace did not seem much impressed.
‘That’s a good thing,’ she observed cheerfully.</p>

<p>They went to Micky’s room after that. They
had to cross the passage and go down some steps
in order to reach it, for it was in the part of the
house which had been the original Fir-tree Cottage,
where the rooms were all much lower—like
cottage rooms in fact. There were but two of
them on the upstairs floor, and the other one was
to be the schoolroom. Underneath these two
rooms were two others, now used as the scullery
and larder. Micky’s room was not quite so
daintily furnished as his sisters’, but it had a delightful
view out on to the lawn and wood beyond,
which made it a very pleasant one. What
especially gratified Micky, however, was its being
alone. ‘You need a man to sleep in this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the house,’ he remarked; ‘burglars would be sure
to choose it to attack, because they’d think there
would be fewer people to shoot them, so it’s a jolly
good thing it’s me you’ve put here, and not the
girls.’</p>

<p>‘Micky always sleeps with his gun at the foot
of his bed, <em>just in case</em>,’ said Kitty.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the dinner-bell rang.</p>

<p>‘Well, I must run and get ready,’ said Aunt
Grace. ‘Can I lend anybody anything?’</p>

<p>‘Thank you; we should be very grateful for a
sponge,’ said Emmeline, ‘and, Aunt Grace,
Micky <em>must</em> wash, mustn’t he? Just look at his
hands!’</p>

<p>Micky made a face at her, and Aunt Grace
said calmly: ‘I expect he will wash: gentlemen
usually do. But I feel it’s a question we must
leave to himself—at all events till his luggage
comes.’</p>

<p>Emmeline flushed crimson. Then a choky
feeling came into her throat; her eyes began to
sting, and she had to hurry out of the room lest
she should burst out crying. It was not only
that she was hurt for herself, but her sense of
loyalty was grieved. Mary had always made
Micky wash his hands before dinner. It would
always be like this, she said to herself. The
others would leave off all the good ways they had
been taught, and whenever Emmeline, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
one who would never forget, tried to remind them,
Aunt Grace would snub her.</p>

<p>The chokiness and the stinging gradually
passed off, and Emmeline could trust her voice
again.</p>

<p>‘Kitty, you really needn’t have gone and told
Aunt Grace about our only having one wash-stand
and dressing-table at home,’ she snapped, as they
were washing their hands.</p>

<p>‘Why ever not?’ asked Kitty, opening her
eyes.</p>

<p>‘It makes us seem such babies,’ said Emmeline,
crossly; ‘and, though of course you and Micky
<em>are</em> babies, it’s rather hard on me.’</p>

<p>Fortunately Kitty was both sweet-tempered
and tactful, so she made no answer, and the subject
dropped. Emmeline, however, went down to
the dining-room in anything but a good temper.
Even the sight of Micky with spotlessly clean face
and hands failed to soothe her; it was exactly like
Micky to go and wash his hands just in order to
make her seem in the wrong.</p>

<p>‘I think this clock is a little bit slow,’ said Aunt
Grace, after a few minutes of eager chatter on
the twins’ part and silence on Emmeline’s, which
an onlooker might have described as sulky, but
which she herself considered dignified. ‘Would
you mind telling me the right time by that lovely
little watch of yours, Emmeline?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Wily Aunt Grace! That little gold watch
which had been given her by her mother was
the pride and joy of Emmeline’s heart. Nothing
so delighted her as to be asked the time. She
gave the required information with the utmost
graciousness; the dining-room clock was exactly
three minutes slow, it seemed, by the right time.
Aunt Grace actually left her seat then and there
and went to the mantelpiece to move on the
minute-hand three spaces, and Emmeline began
to wonder whether a person who cared so much
about the right time, and showed such a proper
amount of faith in her gold watch, could be so
very worldly after all!</p>

<p>The children and Aunt Grace were just setting
out for an exploring expedition in the wood after
dinner when Emmeline suddenly felt Micky, who
was walking by her side a little behind the others,
press a hot, sticky coin into her hand.</p>

<p>‘Why, what is it?’ she asked, with a wonder
which did not grow less when she discovered that
it was a penny.</p>

<p>‘It’s to make up for making that face,’ said
Micky, who had grown very red. ‘It was beastly
rude of me, but for the moment I had quite forgotten
about you being a girl.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Micky darling,’ said Emmeline, so much
touched and ashamed that the tears quite came
into her eyes this time, ‘I really can’t take your
penny. Besides, it was all my fault for interfering.’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t,’ said Micky stoutly. ‘And anyhow,
please do take it. I shan’t feel a gentleman again
till you do. Perhaps,’ he added as an afterthought,
‘you might spend it on some marbles.
I’ve lost so many of mine down the mouse-hole
and other places that there really aren’t enough
now when Kitty wants to play too, and perhaps if
you had some of your own you wouldn’t mind
lending them us sometimes. But don’t, of course,
get them unless you like; it’s only a suggestion.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FEUDAL CASTLE</span></h2>

<p>The early days of the children’s new life were so
full of interest and discoveries that even Emmeline
did not manage to be nearly as homesick as she
fancied she was.</p>

<p>To begin with, they had explored the whole
house, a good deal of the wood, and every inch of
the garden. They had discovered, moreover, that
the said garden was the most delightful of play-places,
chiefly because it was splendid for story
games. It owed its excellence from this point of
view to the fact that it contained a summer-house
and a wood-pile, either or both of which could
serve if need were as houses for the story people
to live in, which, as Kitty remarked, ‘made things
seem ever so much realer.’ To be sure, there
were times when they had to pretend a good deal
about the wood-pile; it just depended how Mr.
Brown, the gardener, had arranged it, but it
usually did for desert islands, where the dwellings
might be supposed to be rather rough and ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and if the worst came to the worst there was
always the summer-house.</p>

<p>For the whole of one glorious red-letter afternoon,
indeed, the story people had revelled in the
run of yet a third house. Just outside the back-yard
was a little shed, always respectfully referred
to by Micky and Kitty as ‘Mr. Brown’s study,’
that being the place where he was accustomed to
black the boots and clean the knives. On the
afternoon in question Mr. Brown had stayed at
home for some reason, so that his study was left
undefended from the twins, who entered in and
took possession. It made an even more desirable
abode than the summer-house, for not only was it
pervaded by a delicious smell of knife-powder and
boot-blacking and mustiness, but also it was much
better furnished; there were stools, and shelves,
and knives, and boots, and packets of seeds and
queer little pots, with nice messy stuff inside
them, whereas in the summer-house there was
nothing at all except a wooden bench, which was
fixed to the wall and ran round three sides of it.
So the story people lived there for the whole of
that afternoon with great satisfaction to themselves,
but, unhappily, not with any satisfaction at
all to Jane when she came to fetch them in to tea
and found Mr. Brown’s usually neat ‘study’ turned
almost inside out, and Micky and Kitty all over
boot-blacking. Aunt Grace and Emmeline returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from a garden-party to find not only the
twins, but Alice, the little day-girl who had been
inveigled into joining the game, in the deepest
disgrace, and Jane muttering terrible things about
‘warnings.’ Fortunately the affair passed off without
such dire consequences, but from that time
forward Mr. Brown’s study was forbidden ground.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment; but consolation
was not long in coming, for it was only a very few
days later that they discovered the Feudal Castle.</p>

<p>Aunt Grace had gone to a garden-party, and
the three children were spending a blissful afternoon
in the wood. Emmeline had curled herself
up comfortably with a story-book, but the twins
happened to be Red Indians that day, and had
gone off on a desperate expedition against the
Pale Faces. Before long they came rushing back
to Emmeline, and insisted on dragging her off to
see ‘something wonderful.’</p>

<p>‘Something wonderful’ proved to be merely an
empty cottage, hardly more than a hut, indeed,
which, from its broken windows, torn thatch,
worm-eaten door, and altogether forlorn appearance,
looked as if it had been deserted for several
years. Emmeline grasped its capabilities at first
sight, and when the twins led her inside and
triumphantly displayed a three-legged chair with
a broken seat, and part of what had once been a
table—when she saw the grate, rusty and cobwebbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with disuse, but a real grate nevertheless,
she was quite ready to agree with them that the
story people had found their ideal house at last.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t this perfectly lovely?’ said Kitty, dancing
about. ‘And, Emmeline, it has two rooms.
Come and see the other one.’</p>

<p>The other room contained nothing at all except
somebody’s very old boot, and a straw hat with
the crown almost out, both of which Kitty pointed
out as great finds. Emmeline, however, was left
cold by these treasures.</p>

<p>‘They look as if they had belonged to rather
dirty people,’ she said. ‘I think we’d better clear
them out. Besides,’ she added, as Kitty looked
disappointed, ‘this is a Feudal Castle, and they
are not the sort of things people in Feudal Castles
would wear.’</p>

<p>From that time forward the empty cottage was
always known as the Feudal Castle. It was felt to
be a most brilliant suggestion of Emmeline’s.</p>

<p>It would have quite spoilt the romance of the
Feudal Castle if it had become a place of common
resort, so from the very first the Bolton children
bound themselves by a solemn pledge of secrecy
not to reveal its existence to anyone. It was in an
unfrequented part of the wood, where they themselves
never happened to have gone before, and it
did not strike them that perhaps other people
might have done so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately they could not spend as much
time in the Feudal Castle as they would have
liked, for lessons began again the very day after
it was discovered. In themselves lessons were
pleasanter than they had ever been before, for
Miss Miller, their new governess, who bicycled
over each morning from one of the neighbouring
villages, was brighter and more interesting than
old-fashioned Miss Rogers. To be sure, Emmeline
was at first inclined to resent it as a slight to
Miss Rogers when she found herself expected to
do by short division sums she had ‘always been
taught’ to do by long; but she was a sensible girl
on the whole, and when once she had thoroughly
mastered the new method, and found out how
much quicker and neater it was than the old one,
she began to take quite a pride in working her
sums by it, and altogether became so docile and
well-behaved a pupil that Miss Miller soon shared
the general opinion that she was a model child.</p>

<p>To Emmeline’s relief, and possibly also a little
to her disappointment, she was not required to
depart from the ways in which she had been
brought up in any more important respects than
that question of short division <em>versus</em> long. So far
from amusing herself all Sunday, as Emmeline
had a vague impression that fashionable people
did, Aunt Grace attended more services than
Mary herself had done, and was certainly just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
particular with regard to the children’s Sunday
observances; indeed, in some ways she was even
more so, for instead of being content with a bare
repetition of the Catechism, she insisted on seeing
that they clearly understood its meaning. And
whereas Emmeline had formerly learned merely a
verse or two of a hymn, Aunt Grace now expected
her to learn the Collect and Gospel for the week,
which was a far more serious task. Emmeline
could not well grumble at it openly, but at the
bottom of her heart she was possibly a little
irritated with Aunt Grace for behaving so very
differently from what she had pictured.</p>

<p>‘There is going to be a Meeting in the village
schoolroom to-night,’ said Aunt Grace as she was
pouring out tea one fine Saturday evening in
September, about a month after the children’s
arrival at Woodsleigh. ‘Mr. Faulkner—that’s
Mrs. Robinson’s clergyman brother—is going to
speak about the work of a Home for poor friendless
boys and girls, of which he is the Chaplain.
I wonder if you three would like to come.’</p>

<p>‘I should like it very much,’ said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Will it be all talking, or will there be a magic
lantern?’ asked Micky, cautious before committing
himself.</p>

<p>‘Will it keep us up lovely and late?’ cried Kitty.</p>

<p>‘I believe there’s to be a magic lantern, and we
shan’t be back till about ten, I suppose,’ said Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Grace; whereupon Kitty gave such a bound of
delight that she nearly upset her tea, and Micky
graciously expressed his opinion that the Meeting
wouldn’t be half bad.</p>

<p>‘Work among children is always particularly
interesting,’ said Emmeline; ‘their characters are
still so plastic that they can be moulded into whatever
shape you want.’ She had once heard a
visitor make the remark, and had treasured it up
for future use.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know you had had such a wide experience
in bringing up young people, Emmeline,’
said Aunt Grace, with a twinkle in her eye; and
Emmeline grew rather red.</p>

<p>‘The only condition I make to the twins’ going
is that they shall lie down after tea till it is time
to start,’ went on Aunt Grace after a moment,
‘else they will be so very tired to-morrow
morning.’</p>

<p>The twins looked rather blank at this. ‘Will
there be supper when we come home?’ asked
Micky.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Aunt Grace, with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Oh well, then, we’ll lie down if you really want
us to,’ said Micky, and as it never occurred to
Kitty to dispute what he had decided, the matter
was regarded as settled.</p>

<p>On their way to the Meeting Aunt Grace told
the children a little about the lecturer, whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had already met in London. For several years
he had worked so devotedly in one of the very
worst parts of the great city that at last his health
had given way, and the doctors had said that for
the present, at all events, it would be madness to
take any but light country duty. At the time the
verdict had almost broken his heart, for he was
quite wrapped up in his people, above all in the
poor little children of the parish, many of whom
were being brought up as pickpockets. It had
been a great consolation to him, however, when
he was offered the Chaplaincy of this Home,
where he knew that his work would still lie among
children like those he had left.</p>

<p>‘Some of them, indeed, are the very same,’
added Aunt Grace. ‘For instance, I know of one
boy there—that is, I think he is there still, though
he must be about the age for leaving by now—whose
life Mr. Faulkner once saved. He wasn’t
a clergyman then, but a doctor, and this boy was
lying at death’s door with diphtheria. He had
been horribly neglected by some cruel people with
whom he lived, and by the time Mr. Faulkner
discovered him the illness had been allowed to get
such a hold that the child would probably have
been choked by some horrible stuff that was
growing in his throat if Mr. Faulkner hadn’t
sucked up the poisonous stuff through a tube
which he put into the throat. Of course, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a terribly dangerous thing to do—indeed, he
caught the illness through doing it—but it saved
the boy’s life. Before that time he had been one
of the most abandoned little child-thieves in the
parish, but ever since he has been absolutely
devoted to Mr. Faulkner, and he is now growing
up into a very fine character. I believe he hopes
to go out as a Missionary one day, which would
be a wonderful end for anyone who began as a
little pickpocket.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Faulkner must be a saint,’ said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘So he is,’ agreed Aunt Grace heartily; ‘but I
don’t know,’ she added, with a whimsical little
smile, ‘whether he’ll any more fit your idea of a
saint than Fir-tree Cottage did that of a cottage.’</p>

<p>Aunt Grace was right. Emmeline could not
help feeling a little shock of surprise when, soon
after they had taken their seats in the schoolroom,
a curly-haired little man, with a round,
merry face, came and stood before the great white
lantern-sheet, and she realised that this must be
the Lecturer.</p>

<p>‘Why, that man’s a little boy!’ remarked Kitty,
in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>And, indeed, there was something very boyish
in his appearance. Not that they had much time
to study it, for in another moment the lights were
lowered, a hymn appeared on the lantern-sheet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and after it had been sung through lustily the
lecture began.</p>

<p>The first picture shown represented a room in
London—such a filthy, miserable room as the
children could never even have imagined. On a
ragged mattress in one corner lay a little boy,
so thin that he was more like a skeleton than a
child. He had been almost dying, it appeared,
when he had been discovered by the Society to
which the Home belonged, and rescued from
death, or worse, for the room had been kept by a
wicked man who was bringing up this child and a
number of others to a life of crime.</p>

<p>The next picture was far less harrowing to
the feelings of the audience, for it showed the
same boy fat, and clean and comfortable after a
few years spent in the beautiful Home among
the Surrey hills, where Mr. Faulkner was now
Chaplain. He had since joined the Royal Navy,
said the clergyman, and was now learning to
serve his King and country as a brave man
should, instead of making a livelihood by robbery.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he’ll be one of my men some day,’
whispered Micky, who had every intention of
ending his life as an Admiral.</p>

<p>Picture followed picture, showing tragic scenes
of child life in darkest London, varied from time
to time by groups of prosperous children whom
the Society had adopted. On the whole it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
much like other lectures of its kind, but the
Bolton children, who had been at nothing of the
sort before, listened and gazed entranced, and
felt very regretful when it was over, and a final
hymn and a collection brought the proceedings
to a close.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson, the Vicar’s wife, hurried forward
to speak to Aunt Grace as soon as the
lights were turned up and people were beginning
to disperse.</p>

<p>‘You’ll come to supper with us to-morrow,
won’t you?’ she said; ‘I know my brother is
much looking forward to meeting you again.’</p>

<p>A pretty rosy colour came into Aunt Grace’s
cheeks. ‘Thank you; I shall be delighted to
come,’ she said, and she looked as though she
meant it.</p>

<p>The Lecturer himself came up to them the next
moment, and greeted Aunt Grace as a friend.</p>

<p>‘You’ll let me see you home?’ he asked,
eagerly; ‘that lane is so long and dark—I know
it of old.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you; but, you see, I have a very
sufficient bodyguard in two nieces and a nephew,’
said Aunt Grace, laughing, ‘and I hear Mrs.
Robinson just inviting the churchwarden and his
wife to go home with her for the express purpose
of meeting you, so I’m afraid it wouldn’t do
to take you away from them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, I shall come to-morrow, then,’ said
Mr. Faulkner. ‘I want to be introduced to your
bodyguard’; and he gave the children a mischievous
look that made him appear more like a
schoolboy than ever.</p>

<p>‘I do love people who have twinkly smiles,’
remarked Kitty to Micky, on the way home after
the meeting in the village schoolroom.</p>

<p>Micky’s great blue eyes had a rapt, far-away
expression.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if it’s worth while,’ he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>‘If what’s worth while?’ asked Kitty.</p>

<p>‘To be so horrid and clean as those children
were in the Homes, even if you do get plenty
to eat.’</p>

<p>‘But, Micky, we are clean—sometimes,’ said
Kitty. It was just as well she qualified the
statement.</p>

<p>‘Yes, but we are used to it,’ said Micky;
‘things aren’t half as bad when you are used
to them.’</p>

<p>‘What part of the lecture did you like best?’
asked Kitty of Emmeline, who was walking
along in dreamy silence.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Emmeline. She
spoke without thinking, for she did know perfectly
well. Mr. Faulkner had spoken of a little
twelve-year-old girl named Kathleen, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
pocket-money had been the very first subscription
towards the building of the particular Home
where he was Chaplain. The heart of this child
had become so full of noble pity for her poor
little brothers and sisters of the slums that she
spent most of her playtime working among them
and for them, and came to have such a wonderful
influence on them, that they looked upon her more
as an angel than an ordinary human girl. The
story had fired Emmeline’s imagination, and she
was dreaming over it still.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t you enjoy the meeting, Aunt Grace?’
asked Kitty, taking her aunt’s hand.</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear. Why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘Because you seem so grave, somehow—like
when we’ve been naughty.</p>

<p>‘I was thinking, I suppose,’ said Aunt Grace,
laughing, and for the rest of the walk she chatted
merrily about all kinds of things.</p>

<p>‘It’s easy to see <em>she</em> doesn’t care much about
the poor children,’ thought Emmeline, feeling
well satisfied with herself; ‘if she did, she wouldn’t
make so many jokes.’</p>

<p>All the way home, and while they were having
supper afterwards, Emmeline went on thinking
of the little girl who had spent her pocket-money
and her playtime on the poor.</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ she said abruptly, in the
middle of her basin of soup, ‘I think it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
be very nice if we had a collecting-box for that
Home. I’ve got a shilling in my money-box
upstairs which I’ll put in for a start. I did
mean to have saved up to buy “Queechy,” but
I’ll gladly give that up for the sake of the poor
little children. Kitty and Micky, if you were unselfish
you’d give up your money too.’</p>

<p>The twins looked blank, and instead of being
touched at Emmeline’s self-sacrifice Aunt Grace
said rather sharply, ‘Really, Emmeline, it is not
your business to settle what the twins ought to
give. Start a box if you like, but I can’t have
you forcing the others to contribute to it.’</p>

<p>Emmeline tried to reflect that this was only
what she might have expected; people’s worldly
relations always did persecute them when they
wanted to do anything specially beautiful or
unselfish; but she could not help looking hurt,
and Kitty, who never could bear anyone to be
snubbed, broke in:</p>

<p>‘Oh, but she didn’t mean to force us, Aunt
Grace. It was only a suggestion. You shall
have my sixpence, Emmeline—at least, threepence
of it will be from me and the other threepence
from Micky. Then it won’t matter his
saving his own money for a new gun. You see,
it’s really <em>necessary</em> he should have one that’s not
broken when he sleeps in such a lonely part of
the house.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Of course,’ agreed Aunt Grace, smiling, as she
twisted one of Kitty’s long curls between her
fingers. ‘Should you like to ask Mr. Faulkner
for a collecting-box when he calls to-morrow,
Emmeline?’ she added, in an unusually kind voice
for a persecuting relation.</p>

<p>‘No; my extra money-box will do quite well,’
said Emmeline shortly.</p>

<p>The extra money-box had been given her by
Micky on her last birthday. Having dropped a
carefully treasured sixpence down that same mouse-hole
which had been fatal to so many of his
marbles, Micky had been at his wits’ end what to
give Emmeline till the happy thought had struck
him of presenting her with his own money-box,
then standing empty and useless. Emmeline had
thanked him for it graciously at the time, but
Micky had always had an uneasy feeling that it
was rather a mean makeshift of a present, so he
was delighted to find it turning out at last to be
really of some use.</p>

<p>‘I think that’s a splendid plan,’ he said; ‘you’ll
be able to open it whenever you want to count
how much money you’ve got, which you can’t do
with the ordinary stupid sort of missionary-box.’</p>

<p>‘There’s a good deal in that,’ said Aunt Grace.
‘See, here’s a bright new shilling as a contribution
to the extra money-box’s first meal. And now I
think it’s time all you young people went to bed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time after she had got into bed that
evening Emmeline lay awake dreaming day-dreams
of that twelve-year-old girl who had been
so wonderfully good to the poor. Strangely
enough, however, the child of her visions was no
longer a stranger, but Emmeline herself—Emmeline,
who had mysteriously become ennobled, and
who was known to everyone as ‘the saintly Lady
Emmeline.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">SUNDAY</span></h2>

<p>There was a letter waiting on Emmeline’s plate
when she came down to breakfast next morning.
Letters were rare and joyful events to the Bolton
children, and Emmeline thought it very annoying
of the servants to troop in for prayers before she
had had time to glance at the contents of this one.</p>

<p>Sunday prayers, however, never took long, and
Emmeline was soon free to fly back to her letter.
To her great delight it proved to be from Mary.</p>

<p>Mary began by saying how very much she was
missing them all, and how often she thought of
them and wondered how they were getting on.
Then followed the really exciting part of the
letter:</p>

<p>‘Do you think your Auntie would let you three
come over and spend the day with me next
Saturday? Eastwich Fair will be going on, and
it would be nice for you to go and see it, especially
as you were disappointed last year on account of
the scarlet fever being in the town. Tell Master
Micky he shall have shrimps for tea if he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
come, and give him and Miss Kitty each a kiss
from me.’</p>

<p>Emmeline looked up from her letter with
sparkling eyes. ‘Oh, Aunt Grace,’ she cried,
‘this is a letter from Mary, asking us three to go
and spend the day with her next Saturday! The
Fair will be going on—that’s why she is asking us
just now. We may go, mayn’t we?’</p>

<p>‘Three cheers for Mary!’ cried Kitty, jumping
up and down, as her custom was when excited.</p>

<p>‘For she’s a jolly good fellow!’ chimed in
Micky, in what Aunt Grace called his sea-captain’s
voice.</p>

<p>‘Have you been used to going to this Fair
other years?’ asked Aunt Grace, who was looking
rather troubled as she poured out the tea.</p>

<p>‘No, because till Grandmamma Moorby died
we always used to go and stay with her for
August and September, and last year there was
the scarlet fever; but we may go this year, mayn’t
we, Aunt Grace?’ repeated Emmeline a little
impatiently.</p>

<p>‘I must think about it, Emmeline,’ said Aunt
Grace quietly. ‘Kitty, will you pass Emmeline
her tea—for one thing, Saturday isn’t a whole
holiday, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but we can work on Wednesday afternoon,’
said Emmeline; ‘one whole holiday comes
to the same thing as two half ones.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Not quite,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘your afternoon
work is never so much as what you do in the
morning. But we’ll see whether it can be
arranged.’</p>

<p>‘“We’ll see” always means “yes” in the end,’
said Kitty.</p>

<p>‘No, Kitty,’ said Aunt Grace, rather distressed,
‘I don’t at all promise. I should like you to
have the pleasure, but I don’t yet know whether
it will be possible.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Aunt Grace!’ cried Kitty, pouting a little,
‘you <em>can’t</em> not let us go to the Fair. There are
such <em>darling</em> baby elephants!’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ added Micky, ‘and there are boats which
go up and down, and up and down, and round and
round, till you get as lovely and seasick as if you
were on the real sea!’ Micky spoke without any
thought of sarcasm.</p>

<p>‘Dear me! I should be very sorry to stand
in the way of Micky’s having the pleasure of being
seasick!’ said Aunt Grace, with one of her funny
little smiles. ‘I’ll see what can be done, children.
But don’t say any more about it just now.’</p>

<p>The twins were a good-humoured little couple,
and quite aware that Aunt Grace was always glad
to give them pleasure when she could, so they left
off teasing to go to the Fair and devoted their
attention to their boiled eggs. Eggs were a
special Sunday treat. Emmeline, however, ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
even her egg in glum silence. Perhaps it was
scarcely consistent for a young lady who judged
her aunt so severely for worldliness to set her
heart on attending a fair, but the best of us are
inconsistent sometimes. Besides, it was not only
the possible loss of the pleasure itself which she
resented; there was Mary’s disappointment to be
thought of—dear Mary, who had been like a
mother to them all while Aunt Grace was enjoying
herself in London. Altogether Emmeline felt
that she did well to be angry, and went on nursing
her grievance all the morning.</p>

<p>The day was a wet one. In the morning it
drizzled, though not enough to keep the party
from church, but at lunch-time the rain began to
descend in such torrents that the usual Sunday
walk was clearly out of the question.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got some letters I must write,’ said Aunt
Grace as they rose from the table, ‘but I shall
have finished them before very long, and then I
shall be very pleased to go on with “The Pilgrim’s
Progress.”’</p>

<p>She went to the drawing-room, where Emmeline
followed her, with the intention of writing an
aggrieved letter to Mary, while Micky and Kitty
repaired to the schoolroom on some business of
their own.</p>

<p>Somehow Emmeline’s grievance did not seem
quite so impressive when she came to write it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down, or perhaps it was that her pen still travelled
too slowly for her thoughts. In any case she
grew bored presently, and wandered upstairs to
the schoolroom to see what the twins were doing.
Judging from the eager sound of their voices as
she drew near the schoolroom door, it seemed to
be something interesting.</p>

<p>She found them sitting on the floor, playing
with their bricks.</p>

<p>‘Well, I never!’ she exclaimed with a very good
imitation of Jane’s voice of righteous wrath. ‘To
think of playing with bricks on Sunday! You
<em>know</em> Mary never let us.’ Emmeline spoke in a
quite sincere belief that it was her duty as an
elder sister to keep the twins in the way that they
should go, but perhaps her elder-sisterly mission
was all the easier to-day because she was in a bad
humour with the world in general.</p>

<p>The twins only giggled in an exasperating way.
‘Mary isn’t here now,’ sang out Micky.</p>

<p>‘And I’m sure Aunt Grace wouldn’t mind,’
added Kitty defiantly.</p>

<p>The hard lump which Emmeline knew so well
at such times rose suddenly in her throat. So
even the twins were going over to the enemy!
‘Well, of all the horrid, forgetting children!’ she
exclaimed hotly, while the tears rushed to her
eyes, and again the twins laughed in a provoking
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why, what’s happening here?’ asked Aunt
Grace’s voice as she opened the schoolroom
door.</p>

<p>‘It <em>is</em> a Sunday game—really and truly it is,’
declared Kitty.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t,’ said Emmeline. ‘They would never
have thought of playing with bricks on Sunday at
home.’</p>

<p>‘It is quite a Sunday game,’ repeated Kitty.
‘We are starting a Home for brick widows and
orphans. The long bricks are the widows and
the little ones the orphans. It was last night
that made us think of it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Micky, ‘to-morrow we shall play
that the brick-box is a thieves’ den, and the little
bricks will be clever little boy-thieves, and the
big ones grown-up burglars. That will be much
more exciting, only Kitty thought the Home was
best for Sunday.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with Kitty,’ said Mr. Faulkner, who
had come into the schoolroom behind Aunt Grace
without the children noticing him in the heat of
the argument. Emmeline looked rather abashed
now that she was aware of his presence, but the
twins were dauntless as ever.</p>

<p>‘Well, suppose you put the widows and
orphans back into the Home now,’ Aunt Grace
suggested, ‘and then, if you come down into the
drawing-room, Mr. Faulkner will tell some interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stories about the real orphans. Won’t you,
Mr. Faulkner?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell stories certainly,’ he replied; ‘whether
they’ll be interesting is another matter.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, they will,’ said Kitty. ‘We were ever
so interested last night, weren’t we, Micky?’</p>

<p>‘That was partly because of the lantern,’ said
Micky frankly, as he flung unfortunate brick
orphans violently back into the brick-box Home;
‘but the stories were decent, too,’ he added kindly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the whole party were seated
in the drawing-room. The children listened with
rapt attention as Mr. Faulkner told stories, some
so funny that his audience went into fits of uproarious
laughter, and some so pathetic that
Aunt Grace’s eyes filled with tears. Even Emmeline
was charmed out of her crossness, and became
like a different being.</p>

<p>‘Do tell us some more about that wonderful
little Kathleen who was so very good to the poor—the
child you spoke about last night,’ she
pleaded, as Mr. Faulkner paused for a moment.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Aunt Grace, almost sharply for her;
‘that was the only part of last night’s lecture I
didn’t enjoy. I think that little girl was in a
false position altogether.’</p>

<p>Mr. Faulkner looked decidedly taken aback.
‘But surely you approve of children trying to
help their less happy brothers and sisters?’ he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said Aunt Grace, ‘but the help
should be of a suitable kind. That child was
encouraged to patronise people who were in many
ways better and wiser than herself, and certainly
far more experienced. I am sure such patronage
does harm, not only to those on whom it is
bestowed, but to the child who gives it. I expect
your little girl soon became self-conscious and
self-conceited, however pure her motives may
have been to start with.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t say as to that, for I never knew the
child,’ said Mr. Faulkner, ‘but as to the effect of
her influence, I am sure from many things I have
heard that it was nothing but good.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Faulkner, can you turn coach-wheels?’
broke in Micky anxiously. He felt much inclined
to develop a hero-worship for Mr. Faulkner, but
could not quite make up his mind to do so till he
was satisfied on this important point.</p>

<p>‘Rather!’ said Mr. Faulkner. ‘I’d show you
now if it wasn’t Sunday, but I’ll tell you what—if
Miss Bolton will let me, I’ll come again to-morrow
afternoon, and you and I will have a coach-wheel
exhibition. By the way, I suppose you can turn
them yourself?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, Micky could go in for a coach-wheel
championship,’ said Aunt Grace proudly.</p>

<p>‘And can you ride bare-back?’ pursued
Micky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I have done so on occasion,’ said Mr. Faulkner,
laughing. ‘Can you?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I haven’t yet,’ Micky owned, ‘but I
mean to when our donkey comes. We’re going
to buy a donkey, you know, as soon as Aunt
Grace gets her next quarter’s money.’</p>

<p>So the merry talk went on, while all the time
Emmeline sat by in silent indignation. To think
of Aunt Grace daring to disapprove of the wonderful
child who was Emmeline’s ideal! But
Aunt Grace wanted everybody to be as frivolous
and worldly as herself!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">A VISIT TO MARY</span></h2>

<p>‘I have been asking the Robinsons about the
Fair,’ said Aunt Grace, on Monday morning,
‘and I think it will be all right for you to go under
Mary’s charge. But I don’t want it to be on
a Saturday. I wonder if she would be able to
have you to-day week instead.’</p>

<p>‘It might put out her plans to change the
day,’ objected Emmeline, more from a perverse
desire to find fault than because she seriously
thought so. ‘Why shouldn’t we go on a
Saturday?’</p>

<p>‘Because I don’t choose for you to go on a
school-holiday, when the place will be crowded
with children,’ said Aunt Grace. ‘There’s no
saying what you mightn’t catch. If Mary can’t
have you on the Monday I’m afraid you must
give up the idea of going to the Fair, but I
think it would be worth while to write and ask
her.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Emmeline, in a voice which
sounded more sulky than pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh dear, shall I ever understand Emmeline?
sighed Aunt Grace to herself, when her niece had
gone off to the schoolroom. ‘Micky and Kitty
are dear little things, but I always seem somehow
to rub Emmeline the wrong way. I thought
she would have been so pleased about this Fair.’</p>

<p>So at the bottom of her heart Emmeline was,
but a kind of cross-grained loyalty made her
resent Aunt Grace’s having thought it needful to
consult the Robinsons as to whether a treat
proposed by Mary was suitable. It was that
feeling which had been at the bottom of her
ungracious manner.</p>

<p>Emmeline’s objection that Mary might be
inconvenienced by the change of dates proved
a groundless one. A warm letter arrived in the
course of a day or two to say that she would be
only too much delighted to see the children on
Monday, if that suited best; and so without
further ado it was arranged.</p>

<p>Three eager heads were craned out of the
carriage window, when on the following Monday
morning the Woodsleigh train slowly steamed
into Eastwich Station. Everyone wanted to be
the first to catch sight of Mary. ‘There she is!’
screamed Micky, and ‘I see her!’ shrieked Kitty,
as they fixed on two different ladies, neither of
whom proved on closer view to resemble Mary
in the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But wherever can Mary be?’ cried Kitty,
when she was convinced of her mistake.</p>

<p>‘I thought she would have been sure to
come and meet us,’ said Mick, in an injured
voice.</p>

<p>‘We’ll wait here a few minutes, just in case
something has hindered her,’ said Emmeline, ‘and
then if she doesn’t come we’ll make our own
way to the house.’</p>

<p>The few minutes passed, and still there was no
sign of Mary, so they presently left the station
and set out by themselves for her house. Emmeline
was in the best of good humours, and made herself
quite charming to her little brother and sister.
She liked nothing so well as to find herself in a
position of authority.</p>

<p>The walk was not long. In a very few
minutes they were bursting open Mary’s front
door, and rushing down the little passage to the
kitchen, with joyous cries of ‘Mary, we’re here!’
‘Mary, we’ve come!’</p>

<p>Mary was seated in an arm-chair by the fire.
‘Take care, dearie,’ she explained, as Micky was
charging at her recklessly. ‘I’ve sprained my
ankle rather badly, and though it doesn’t hurt
so much now, it wouldn’t do to knock it. I do
feel that vexed with myself for having done such
a stupid thing to-day of all days. Well, my
darlings, this <em>is</em> nice to see you again! Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Master Micky, I do believe you’ve grown even
in these few weeks since I saw you.’</p>

<p>‘I must have grown too, then,’ chimed in
Kitty: ‘our two heads come to just exactly the
same place on the schoolroom door.’ Kitty was
quite willing that Micky should be acknowledged
her superior in every other way, but that he should
have the palm for tallness was rather too much
even for her twin-sisterly devotion.</p>

<p>‘So you have, my darling,’ said Mary, while
Emmeline anxiously asked after the sprain.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it won’t be anything much,’ said Mary,
‘but I’m afraid I shan’t be able to use my foot
for the next few days, and what bothers me is
how you’re to go to the Fair without me. Of
course, it’s as quiet as it can be just now—it’s
only on Saturday afternoons and in the evenings
it gets a bit rough—so I don’t see myself how you
could possibly come to harm under Miss Emmeline’s
charge, but maybe Miss Bolton wouldn’t
think it quite the thing. If only I knew anyone
whom I could ask to go with you, but I don’t—not
at such short notice,’ and Mary’s pleasant face
looked thoroughly worried.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure Aunt Grace wouldn’t mind our going
with Emmeline,’ said Kitty.</p>

<p>‘No, she’s much too jolly,’ agreed Micky.</p>

<p>Emmeline could not feel so sure. An uncomfortable
remembrance came to her that Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Grace had specially said they might go under
Mary’s charge. Did that mean that they might
go by themselves now that Mary was unable to
escort them?</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you think, Miss Emmeline
dear?’ asked Mary, anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Emmeline,’ pleaded Kitty, as Emmeline
still hesitated, ‘of course she wouldn’t mind!
Why you’re twelve years old—almost grown up.’</p>

<p>That decided Emmeline. She could not bear
to lose prestige in the eyes of the little sister
who thought her almost grown up. ‘I’m sure
Aunt Grace couldn’t mind,’ she said boldly; ‘she
knows I’m quite to be trusted to look after the
others.’</p>

<p>‘That you are, my darling,’ agreed Mary, rather
too easily reassured—as a nurse it had been her
one weakness that she never could endure to disappoint
the children—‘and Micky and Kitty will
be as good as gold, I’m sure’; whereupon the
twins assumed the expressions of a pair of youthful
saints.</p>

<p>‘May Micky and I look at the picture Bible?’
suggested Kitty meekly. Whenever the twins
visited that house—they had often done so in
the days when Mary was still their nurse—one
of two amusements was the recognised order of
the day. Either they played—not the real game,
but one of their own invention—with a set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
elaborate Indian chessmen brought home by a
sailor brother of Mary’s; or else they looked at
the pictures of a fascinating old French Bible which
had somehow come into the possession of Mary’s
grandfather.</p>

<p>‘And now, dearie, tell me all about how you’ve
been getting on,’ said Mary, as soon as there was
quiet in the room, owing to the twins having
become blissfully absorbed in the picture of the
plague of frogs in the old French Bible. It always
sent delicious thrills through them to discover
frogs hopping lightheartedly out of Pharaoh’s very
modern looking soup tureen, or creeping out from
between his bedclothes.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace is kind in her own way,’
acknowledged Emmeline—she was always candid
about people’s merits even when she disapproved
of them—‘but living with her isn’t like living
with you, Mary.’</p>

<p>‘Well, dear, it’s not to be expected it should
be, seeing that she’s a young lady, and me only
an old nurse,’ said Mary simply; ‘but I’m sure
whatever changes there are will work out right
in the end, for I know she is fond of you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, she’s fond of us—that is, she is fond of
the twins,’ said Emmeline, ‘but she doesn’t care
about the sort of things mother cared about,
and you care about. What she really cares for is
dressing prettily and going to parties, and so on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t think, dear, we can judge what’s in
other people’s hearts,’ said Mary, slowly. She
felt somewhat at a loss how to answer Emmeline,
for she was too good and loyal to encourage the
child in criticising her aunt, but she herself had
been brought up to regard most amusements as
dangerous, if not actually sinful, and there was
no doubt that Aunt Grace was very gay and
merry.</p>

<p>‘But I’m not judging what’s in her heart, but
what she says,’ persisted Emmeline. ‘I’ll just
tell you what she said the other day’; and she
related the conversation with Mr. Faulkner about
the little Kathleen who had been like an angel to
the poor. ‘<em>You</em> don’t think it’s true that children
only do harm when they try to do work of that
sort?’ she ended.</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ said Mary; ‘I think a guileless
child can often do more than anyone else to
touch a sinner’s heart.’ Mary spoke with earnest
conviction. It was true that she had never
actually come across such a young person as the
guileless child of whom she spoke, but she none
the less firmly believed in the type.</p>

<p>‘Mary, isn’t it nearly time for dinner?’ broke in
Micky at this point. The twins had just reached
the last meal of the Israelites before they left
Egypt, and the picture had put it into Micky’s
head to be hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And, Mary, may we set the table?’ chimed in
Kitty.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of setting the table
when Mary’s brother George came in from work.
He was a burly, good-natured, red-faced person,
chiefly remarkable for pockets which bulged out
with apples and sweets, and for certain time-honoured
jokes which the children always greeted
with the cordiality due to such old friends.</p>

<p>‘George always pretends he’s going to put us
in his pockets,’ Micky had remarked to Kitty
on one occasion; ‘it’s getting a bit stale.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but we <em>must</em> laugh,’ said Kitty: ‘he’d be
so disappointed if we didn’t,’ and accordingly the
twins always laughed uproariously as soon as
George so much as mentioned his pockets.</p>

<p>They sat down to table after full justice had
been done to these pleasantries, and the meal
that followed might have been one grand joke
from beginning to end to judge from the continual
laughter that went on. Mary had remembered
everybody’s favourite dishes; there was liver and
bacon to please the twins, pancakes for Emmeline,
though Shrove Tuesday was about half a year
distant, and baked potatoes for them all. When
at last everybody had eaten as much of these
good things as they could manage, and George
had gone back to work, it was high time to start
for the Fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I wonder what time I had better have tea
ready for you,’ said Mary, as they were putting
on their hats. ‘Did Miss Bolton say you were to
go back by any particular train?’</p>

<p>‘She said either the 5.5 or the 5.25,’ replied
Emmeline; ‘it doesn’t really matter which, for
she isn’t going to meet us at the station. She’s
going to a croquet-party at the Vicarage this
afternoon, so it would not be convenient, and
you see she always trusts me to look after the
others.’ Perhaps Emmeline would not have
dragged this in if her conscience had been quite
at ease about the afternoon’s expedition.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I’ll expect you back to tea
about a quarter past four,’ said Mary. ‘Miss
Emmeline will be able to keep count of time
with that dear little watch of hers. And now,
my darlings, it’s high time you were off, or
you’ll have to come back almost as soon as you
get there.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a horrid shame you can’t come too, Mary,’
said Micky; and his sisters declared that it wouldn’t
be half so much fun without her.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I don’t know when I’ve been so disappointed
about anything,’ said Mary, with unfeigned
regret; ‘but you’ll have to tell me all
about it when you come back to tea. I shall be
looking forward to that all the afternoon.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">DIAMOND JUBILEE JONES</span></h2>

<p>Perhaps just because she had been looking
forward to the treat so eagerly for days past,
Emmeline’s feeling, when she actually found herself
at the Fair, was one of disappointment.
There, to be sure, were the gaily decorated booths,
there were the merry-go-rounds of all kinds and
degrees, varying from the ring of wooden horses
worked by hand, to the alarming-looking motors
which raced round and round at break-neck speed;
there were the side-shows, with their air of entrancing
mystery to be revealed on payment of
one penny; there, in fact, was everything she
had been led to expect, but somehow the whole
did not make the glittering, fairy-like effect she
had been picturing to herself. Besides, even at
this hour of the afternoon, there were a good
many rough-looking people about, and Emmeline
did not like rough people.</p>

<p>But if Emmeline was disappointed, Micky and
Kitty were not. All the merry-go-rounds were
playing different tunes; all the people who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
anything to sell or to show were proclaiming
its merits at the tops of their voices; the public
was enjoying itself in a very loud fashion; in
fact, everybody was doing everything in the
noisiest manner possible, and the discord of
sounds produced was deafening and delightful to
the twins.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it lovely?’ said Kitty to Micky, as she
skipped about; but Micky did not hear, for he was
engaged in a scornful colloquy with the owner of
the hand-worked wooden horses.</p>

<p>‘Think I’m going to ride on one of those things?’
he was demanding indignantly. ‘Do you take
me for a kid?’</p>

<p>‘Emmeline,’ clamoured Kitty, ‘when may we
go and see the darling elephants?’</p>

<p>‘You girls can do what you like,’ said Micky
grandly, ‘but I’m off for a motor-drive.’</p>

<p>Aunt Grace had provided each twin with a
shilling, and Emmeline with a florin to spend at
the Fair, so that there was plenty of money for
such luxuries as motor-drives.</p>

<p>The motor-drive, or rather several motor-drives,
and the call on the darling elephants were gone
through in due course, and then Micky fell under
the spell of the cocoanut-shy.</p>

<p>‘Do come on, Micky!’ entreated Emmeline,
after he had made many unsuccessful shots; ‘I
believe they’re fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>——’</p>

<p>The rest of her sentence was lost in indignant
astonishment; someone had flicked one of the
little feather brooms known as ‘fair-ticklers’ full
in her face!</p>

<p>‘Come along, Micky,’ she exclaimed, with angry
impatience; ‘I’m sick of this horrid place. Why,
what are you doing?’</p>

<p>For Micky had suddenly flung down the ball
which he was about to shy at the cocoanuts, and
was rushing after a wretched little street arab
of about his own size.</p>

<p>‘Give it up! You little cad!’ he shouted, as he
caught hold of the boy’s ragged jacket. ‘Give it
up this minute!’</p>

<p>‘I ain’t got nothing,’ whined the boy, trying
vainly to wriggle out of Micky’s grasp.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you have. I saw you take it,’ and to
Emmeline’s intense surprise, Micky suddenly
wrenched her own purse out of the street arab’s
dirty hand. Her thoughts had been so much
taken up by the fair-tickler that she had not even
felt it go.</p>

<p>‘I’d give you a jolly good thrashing if you
weren’t such a muff!’ exclaimed Micky.</p>

<p>Emmeline collected her astonished wits with
an effort.</p>

<p>‘Well, you <em>are</em> a naughty little boy,’ she remarked
severely; ‘it would just serve you right if
we gave you up to the police.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The ragged little urchin began to howl. If he
had really been much afraid he would probably
have run away, but this did not strike Emmeline,
and her heart softened towards him, especially
when he sobbed: ‘I ain’t had nothing to eat since
yesterday morning.’</p>

<p>Kitty, who was looking on with wide-open
pitying eyes, gave Emmeline’s hand a sudden
squeeze.</p>

<p>‘May I give him the money I’ve got left?’ she
whispered.</p>

<p>‘Not till we know more about him,’ said Emmeline.
‘Is your father out of work?’ she added
to the boy, with some vague idea that it was the
correct thing to ask questions of that kind before
giving alms.</p>

<p>‘I ain’t got no father nor mother neither,’ he
replied, still in his professional whine.</p>

<p>‘Who looks after you, then?’ asked Emmeline,
more gently.</p>

<p>‘Old Sally Grimes,’ was the answer, ‘but she
ain’t give me nothing to eat since yesterday
morning, and she beat me something awful!’</p>

<p>‘Come along with me,’ said Emmeline. A
sudden idea had taken possession of her.</p>

<p>‘What for?’ asked the boy half suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to give you something to eat,’ said
Emmeline.</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes glistened. It had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
picturesque exaggeration to say that he had had
nothing to eat since yesterday morning, but he
was really very hungry.</p>

<p>‘Thank you kindly, lady,’ he said, and Emmeline
flushed with gratification. ‘Lady’ sounded
so much grander than ‘Missy.’</p>

<p>‘What are you going to give him to eat?’ asked
Micky, with interest. ‘There’s a man selling ice-cream
over there.’</p>

<p>Almsgiving was impossible to Micky just then,
for he had spent all his money (his last two cocoanut
shies had been paid for by Kitty), but he was
quite willing to help with advice.</p>

<p>‘And there’s a girl selling delicious toffee, only
she calls it candy,’ said Kitty. ‘Why does she
call it candy, Emmeline?’</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t think of giving a starving boy
ice-cream, or toffee either,’ said Emmeline.
‘We’ll go where there’s something more sensible
to eat than what you can buy at this Fair. Come
along, children.’</p>

<p>On the whole, the twins were not unwilling to
leave the Fair. It was rather sad to go so soon,
but less so now that twopence of Kitty’s represented
all their remaining fortune than it would
have been half an hour before, and when even
that solitary twopence had been spent on the
mysterious toffee that called itself ‘candy,’ their
willingness to forsake the Fair became eagerness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to see what new thing was about to happen. It
was as good as a story-game come true to wander
through the streets of Eastwich with this delightfully
ragged dirty boy.</p>

<p>‘Where are we going, Emmeline? What are
we going to do?’ they cried.</p>

<p>‘You’ll see,’ said Emmeline.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she did not quite know
herself.</p>

<p>They came out of the Fair into a region of squalid
little shops; squalid, at least, they appeared to
Emmeline, but her protégé saw them from a
different point of view.</p>

<p>‘Please, lady, the fried fish and ’taters in there
is all right,’ he hinted wistfully, as they passed an
overwhelming smell.</p>

<p>Emmeline hesitated. She had vaguely intended
taking him to some superior Tea-Rooms in the
High Street, where she herself had sometimes
gone for a treat, but now she came to think of it,
perhaps the fried-fish shop would be more fitting
in this case.</p>

<p>‘I think we’ll go in here, then,’ she decided, to
her guest’s obvious satisfaction.</p>

<p>A shopman with a much stained apron gazed at
the party in some astonishment as they entered,
but he seemed to think Emmeline a trustworthy
person, for he made no demur when she ordered a
plate of fried fish and potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What’s your name, little boy?’ asked Emmeline,
when the shopman had disappeared into the
back regions, and they were seated waiting at a
grimy table covered with American leather in
imitation of marble.</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jub’lee Jones,’ replied the boy glibly.</p>

<p>‘What an extraordinary name!’ exclaimed
Emmeline, and the twins began to giggle.</p>

<p>‘I were born on Diamond Jub’lee day,’ he
explained, with evident pride.</p>

<p>‘Well, Diamond Jubilee, I’m sure with such a
splendid birthday you ought to be a very good,
honest boy,’ said Emmeline, by way of improving
the occasion. ‘What would Queen Victoria have
said if anyone had told her that a boy born on
her Diamond Jubilee would ever take to picking
people’s pockets? Why, she would have been
awfully upset.’</p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee looked round the shop furtively,
as though to assure himself that there was
nobody within hearing. ‘That ain’t to please
meself I picks pockets,’ he mumbled; ‘that’s
Mother Grimes. She beats us something awful if
we don’t bring nothing home.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say she is bringing you up
as a thief!’ exclaimed Emmeline, in a horrified
voice.</p>

<p>What Diamond Jubilee might have answered
will never be known, for just at that moment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shopman came back with the fried fish and potatoes,
and private conversation was stopped for the time
being. Diamond Jubilee threw himself on the
food like a ravenous animal, while Micky and
Kitty looked on with a fascinated stare. From
their point of view, his table manners were quite
as well worth watching as those of the elephants
they had just been visiting.</p>

<p>Emmeline’s point of view was a more fastidious
one, and at any other time she might have been
disgusted, but to-day it was with a certain tolerance
that she saw Diamond Jubilee put his knife into
his mouth. His last words had shed a halo of
romance round his unkempt head. It was to
children like him that Kathleen had been a good
angel.</p>

<p>With that last thought, a plan flashed into
Emmeline’s brain—a plan so strange and startling
that it almost took her breath away for the
moment, and so glorious that it made her want to
jump and dance about the shop, only that would
have been out of keeping with the dignity of the
wonderful plan.</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee, if you have quite done, will
you come outside? I’ve something important to
tell you.’ Emmeline’s heart was thumping so
that she could hardly get the words out.</p>

<p>‘Well, there ain’t nothing more on this here
plate,’ said Diamond Jubilee, giving it a final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
scrape. Perhaps he hoped that she would offer a
second helping, but she scarcely even heard what
he said.</p>

<p>‘Stop a bit, miss!’ called the shopman, as she
seized hold of Diamond Jubilee’s arm, and began
hurrying him out of the shop. ‘You haven’t paid,
miss.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, bother!’ cried Emmeline, impatiently. ‘I
was quite forgetting. How much is it?’</p>

<p>‘Three halfpence, please, miss.’</p>

<p>Her fingers were trembling with excitement as
she fumbled for the money in her little brown
leather purse.</p>

<p>‘That’ll be right, thank you, miss,’ he said, as
she threw it down on the counter.</p>

<p>At last they were out in the street again, and
she was free to tell the marvellous plan with which
for the last two minutes she had been almost
bursting. ‘Diamond Jubilee,’ she demanded,
again laying her hand in a motherly way on his
very dirty and rather smelly jacket sleeve, ‘don’t
you feel a longing sometimes for a better life?’</p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee stared at her as though he did
not understand the question.</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you like to get away from Mother
Grimes, and go to live with people who would
teach you to be a good boy and always be kind to
you?’ she asked, the words almost tumbling over
one another in her eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Diamond Jubilee, ‘maybe I would,
maybe I wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>Emmeline was conscious of a sudden chill of
disappointment. This was not the way she had
pictured him hailing the prospect of deliverance
from Mother Grimes and his present life. But
perhaps his indifferent manner simply meant that
he did not even yet quite understand.</p>

<p>‘Because if you would like it,’ she went on
very slowly and distinctly, ‘I’ll take you home
with me.’</p>

<p>‘Emmeline!’ gasped Kitty, ‘whatever <em>will</em>
Aunt Grace say?’ Even to her simple mind,
it seemed a somewhat unusual proceeding to
adopt a strange boy out of the streets on
the strength of his having tried to pick one’s
pocket.</p>

<p>Micky, however, saw things from a less conventional
standpoint. ‘I say, Emmeline, what a
stunning lark!’ he exclaimed. ‘Why, it will be
almost like keeping another dog!’</p>

<p>Meantime, Diamond Jubilee was regarding
Emmeline with a critical stare, very unlike the
deferential gratitude she felt he ought to have
shown. ‘Garn!’ he said, suspiciously. ‘You’re
kidding me, ain’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what you mean by kidding you,’
said Emmeline, with dignity. ‘If you come home
with me you shall have plenty to eat and a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
house to live in. I promise you that, and I
always keep my promises.’</p>

<p>Even after Emmeline’s assurance that he
should have plenty to eat and a nice home,
Diamond Jubilee did not look as if he altogether
trusted her. Still, she had just given him the best
meal he had had for a long time past, and life with
Mother Grimes had been particularly unpleasant
lately.… ‘Well,’ he said doubtfully, ‘maybe—I’ll
come.’</p>

<p>‘Does that mean you will come, or you won’t?’
said Emmeline.</p>

<p>He gave her another critical stare before
answering, ‘I don’t mind if I do.’</p>

<p>She knew that this was a way of accepting her
offer, and though she could not help feeling
nettled, it was too late now to draw back.
Besides, it might only be an unfortunate manner
which made Diamond Jubilee seem so indifferent.
‘Well, then, listen what you’ve got to do,’ she
commanded in her briskest and most capable
voice. ‘We must hurry back now to have tea
with a friend who is expecting us, and though of
course you can’t come in, as you haven’t been
invited, you must come with us and wait outside,
or you won’t know where to find us again. We
shan’t stay more than half an hour, and after
that we’ll take you to your new home. And
now you had better walk a little way behind us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
It’s not that we don’t like walking with you,
but it might lead to awkward questions if people
met you with us,’ she added hastily, for fear of
hurting his feelings.</p>

<p>She need not have been afraid. He had no
special desire to walk with these strange children,
who had so unexpectedly adopted him, so he fell
back in stolid indifference.</p>

<p>‘Emmeline,’ said Kitty uneasily, as they
hurried along towards Mary’s house, ‘it will be
a tremendous surprise for Aunt Grace when
Diamond Jubilee turns up.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the jolliest lark that ever was!’ Micky
was exclaiming, on her other side, ‘I never
thought you were so sporting, Emmeline.’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t sporting at all,’ said Emmeline, with
dignity. ‘You don’t seem to understand, Micky,
that this is a good work, and not a game.’</p>

<p>‘But are you <em>quite sure</em> that Aunt Grace won’t
be cross?’ asked Kitty.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace won’t have anything to do with
him,’ said Emmeline, rather defiantly. ‘It’s we
who are adopting him, not her. Nobody else
will know anything about him, not even Mary.
I’d like to tell her, but I’m afraid it wouldn’t be
safe. She might think it her duty to tell Aunt
Grace—one never quite knows with grown-up
people, even the nicest of them.’</p>

<p>‘But how are you going to manage about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
food and the nice house to live in, if nobody’s to
know about him?’ was Kitty’s very natural
question.</p>

<p>‘He’ll live in the Feudal Castle, and we’ll buy
his food with the money in my extra money-box,’
said Emmeline. ‘It’ll be quite all right to
use it in that way, for it was for poor little
children such as Diamond Jubilee that we collected
it.’</p>

<p>For about five seconds the twins gazed at her
open-mouthed. Such a scheme was beyond their
most brilliant imaginings. Then Micky startled the
passers-by with a wild war-whoop, and Kitty
gasped: ‘How perfectly bea-u-tiful! Why, it’ll be
just like the Young Pretender—taking him food,
I mean, and keeping his hiding-place secret from
everybody.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll have to bind ourselves by a solemn oath
of secrecy,’ cried Micky. ‘Here goes—if I
let out about Diamond Jubilee, may I and my
descendants——’</p>

<p>‘Micky, you know Aunt Grace said we weren’t
to say that,’ said Kitty, in a voice of distress.</p>

<p>‘No, Micky; it’s not nice,’ said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘I was only going to say, “May we lose our
shirt-studs even to the hundredth generation!”
said Micky, calmly. ‘Aunt Grace invented that
herself, so there!’</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">TRIALS OF PHILANTHROPY</span></h2>

<p>‘Well, Miss Emmeline, dear, you know best
what Miss Bolton would like, so I won’t try to
over-persuade you, though I’m real sorry you can’t
stay just till the 5.25.’ Poor Mary could not
understand what had come over her guests. All
through that delicious tea of shrimps and strawberry
jam, which she had especially provided for
the occasion, they had seemed curiously restless
and excited, and now here was Emmeline actually
insisting on returning by the earlier of the two
trains she had mentioned.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid Aunt Grace—I mean, I think it
would make us rather too late getting home,’ said
Emmeline, rather confusedly, as she kicked Micky
and Kitty under the table by way of a hint to
them to hold their tongues. Perhaps on an
ordinary occasion the twins might not have taken
the hint so submissively, but at that moment they
were too eager to see what was going to happen
next to mind either being kicked or being hurried
away from Mary’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Then, if you really think so, I’m afraid it’s
about time you were starting,’ said Mary regretfully;
‘George will be sadly disappointed not to
see you again, but that can’t be helped.’</p>

<p>‘You must give him our best respects,’ said
Kitty—(George always sent his best respects to
them, so Kitty supposed it was the correct form of
message)—‘and here’s some toffee for him—at
least, it’s called candy, though it really is toffee.
It has got a little crumby and pockety, but
perhaps he’ll excuse that, and it may comfort
him. Toffee’s a wonderful comfort sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Kitty, George wouldn’t think of
taking your toffee, bless your heart!’ said Mary,
kissing the child, as she helped her on with her
hat; ‘but I’ll tell him you wanted to give it him,
and that will comfort him.’</p>

<p>‘I should have thought myself it would only
have disappointed him more,’ said Kitty; ‘but
you know best, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Well, we must really be starting,’ said Emmeline,
in a nervous fever. She was terribly afraid
that Diamond Jubilee might have grown tired of
waiting outside, and have run away.</p>

<p>Mary hobbled with them as far as the door.
‘It has been just lovely having you,’ she remarked,
as she opened it to let them out. ‘I
only wish, though, I could have come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
station to see you off’—a wish which, under
the circumstances, they could hardly echo.</p>

<p>For Diamond Jubilee was still faithfully waiting
for them a few yards farther down the street.
At the moment they came out he was contentedly
munching a banana. If Emmeline’s acquaintance
with him had been more intimate she might have
suspected that it had been stolen from the fruit-store
at the corner; as it was, this did not strike her,
and her pleasure at seeing him still there, and so
happily employed, was only spoilt by the fear lest,
by too eager a greeting, he should betray them to
Mary, who stood at the door affectionately
watching them down the street. She need not
have been afraid, however. A cool ‘Hello!’
which if Mary heard, she simply took for the
casual salutation of a free-and-easy little stranger,
was the only notice he vouchsafed them.</p>

<p>‘Walk a good way behind us,’ she managed
to whisper as she passed him, and to her great
relief he obeyed readily enough.</p>

<p>Another moment, and, with last waves of the
hand to Mary, they had turned the corner.
Emmeline breathed freely again, though she still
thought it wise to walk a little in front of their
adopted son, just in case they met any of their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>On the way to the station Emmeline explained
her plans to Micky and Kitty. ‘I’ve still got sixpence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
halfpenny left of my Fair money,’ she said
‘and I should think that would be enough to buy
Diamond Jubilee a half-ticket to Chudstone.’</p>

<p>‘But Woodsleigh is our station,’ said Micky.</p>

<p>‘Well, we are going to get out at Chudstone
this afternoon,’ said Emmeline; ‘for one thing,
the half-ticket to Woodsleigh would cost a penny
more than I’ve got, and for another thing, it
wouldn’t be safe to take Diamond Jubilee through
the village, where everybody knows us, and they
would be sure to talk. Besides, our way home
from Chudstone will lie through the wood, so we
shall be able to take him to the Feudal Castle
without going out of our way hardly at all. Of
course, it will take us about a quarter of an hour
longer than if we had come from Woodsleigh
Station, but I chose the earlier train on purpose to
allow for that.’</p>

<p>‘You <em>are</em> clever, Emmeline!’ exclaimed Kitty.
‘I should never have thought of all that.’</p>

<p>‘I’m four years older than you are, you see,’
said Emmeline modestly, though she was flattered
by the compliment. ‘I think,’ she continued,
‘that it will be better if Diamond Jubilee travels
in a separate compartment.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t he think it rather horrid of us?’ said
Micky.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see why he should mind it any more
than he does walking behind us now,’ said Emmeline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
‘and I’m sure it will be safer not to seem to
belong to him. You never know whom you may
meet in the train.’</p>

<p>We know that the best laid schemes both of
mice and men are apt to go wrong, but on this
occasion Emmeline’s really seemed as though they
were going to be the exception to prove the rule.
The party arrived at the station without any adventures;
Diamond Jubilee’s ticket cost only five-pence
halfpenny; without any difficulty she found
an empty compartment for him, and an almost
empty one next door to it for herself and the
twins; last, but not least, they met no acquaintances
at the station, so that although one or two
porters stared at seeing Emmeline’s interest in
such a dirty, ragged, and altogether disreputable
little street-arab as Diamond Jubilee, nobody
ventured to ask any awkward questions.</p>

<p>It was with a piece of stupidity on Diamond
Jubilee’s part that the tide of luck seemed to turn.
Emmeline had done her best to impress on him
that he must get out of the train as soon as he
heard the porters shouting ‘Chudstone,’ but, in
spite of her instructions, he as nearly as possible
let himself be carried on. She had not meant to
appear to have anything to do with him at Chudstone,
where they were quite likely to be recognised,
but in desperation she was obliged to tell
the porter that there was a little boy in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
carriage who wanted to get out. On the whole,
she thought that course better than to open the
door herself and bid him get out.</p>

<p>The man’s look of suspicion, when he opened
the door and saw Diamond Jubilee calmly staring
out of the opposite window, was only too obvious.</p>

<p>‘Where’s your ticket?’ he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>The fact that Diamond Jubilee happened to
have mislaid it did not mend matters. The porter
became abusive, and Emmeline was at her wits’
end what to do, between her fear lest, if she stayed
to see the end of the fray, her connection with
Diamond Jubilee might be suspected, and her conviction
that if she left the station without him the
chances were that she should lose sight of him
altogether.</p>

<p>Luckily, the ticket was discovered underneath
the cushion before Emmeline was obliged to come
to the rescue, and with an angry injunction from
the porter to ‘get out, and not give no more
trouble,’ Diamond Jubilee was allowed to go free.</p>

<p>‘Really, I do think you might have managed
better,’ Emmeline could not help telling him impatiently
when they were safe outside the station.
‘Now, whatever you do, keep well behind us till
we are out of the village.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid he’s going to turn out a duffer,’
remarked Micky, as Diamond Jubilee obediently
fell back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Micky, you mustn’t talk like that,’ said Emmeline,
the more severely because at the bottom of
her heart she could not help fearing that there
might be some truth in what he said.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that they had not much of the
village to go through before they branched off into
the blackberry-grown byway which led to the
wood, for, as it was, Diamond Jubilee’s appearance
attracted a rather disagreeable amount of staring.
No one molested him, however, or seemed to connect
him with the well-dressed children who were
walking some ten yards in front of him, and the
party were soon safe in the wood, out of reach of
curious eyes and whispering tongues.</p>

<p>‘You’ll soon be home now,’ said Emmeline,
turning round to give him an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee grinned, well pleased. He
had the vaguest idea of what these little gentle-folks’
home would be like, but he hoped there
might be another square meal awaiting him there,
perhaps even more delicious than the one he had
had at the fried-fish shop.</p>

<p>Great was his astonishment when the children,
after walking through the wood for miles, as it
seemed to him, came to a triumphant pause before
a deserted and tumble-down hut.</p>

<p>‘There, Diamond Jubilee,’ said Emmeline in a
voice of congratulation, ‘this is to be your own
dear little home.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee gazed at the dear little home
in speechless surprise for a moment, after which
he managed to say feebly:</p>

<p>‘Garn! You’re kidding me. That ain’t never
where you live!’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t where <em>we</em> live,’ explained Kitty eagerly;
‘we live in a stupid house just like everybody
else; but it’s where <em>you</em> are going to live. Oh,
you will be jolly!’</p>

<p>‘You don’t want to think I’m going to live in
that there dirty hole all by meself,’ said Diamond
Jubilee with kindling wrath, ‘’cos I aren’t—not if
it’s ever so.’</p>

<p>‘But we’ll be here so much that you won’t have
time to be lonely—truly you won’t,’ pleaded
Emmeline, no less surprised than dismayed at the
turn things were taking. ‘Do come inside like a
dear, good boy, and you’ll see how nice it is.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, do come in, Diamond Jubilee,’ coaxed
Kitty; ‘it’s just <em>lovely</em> inside—you can’t think.’</p>

<p>‘And what would you do if you were wrecked
on a desert island if you make such a fuss now?’
said Micky, in his most reasonable voice.</p>

<p>As Diamond Jubilee had not the slightest intention
of being wrecked on a desert island, this
consideration had little weight with him, and it
took a good many more persuasions to induce
him to cross the threshold of the Feudal Castle.
When at last he was inside he was so far from mollified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at the look of it, and of the three-legged
chair without a seat, and the table-top, that he
burst into a dismal wail.</p>

<p>‘I won’t stay here—I won’t!’ he sobbed. ‘You
ought to be ashamed of yourselves, that you do,
for taking me in so shameful.’</p>

<p>Emmeline had to wink her eyes hard to keep
back the tears; it was all turning out so utterly
unlike what she had expected. ‘You’re a very
foolish, ungrateful boy!’ she exclaimed. ‘I’m
sure this must be at least as comfortable as
Mother Grimes’s house, and you ought to be only
too thankful to be where nobody will beat you,
and you’ll have plenty to eat.’</p>

<p>‘There was two beds at Sally Grimes’s,’ said
Diamond Jubilee, resentfully, ‘and there was
three or four on us slept in each, which was
company-like, and kept us warm.’</p>

<p>Poor Emmeline! She had heard of those
crowded beds before, always with a shudder of
horror, and now here was her thankless protégé
actually regretting them! ‘Look here, Diamond
Jubilee,’ she said, ‘if you’ll only be patient we’ll
buy you bedclothes, and so on, as soon as ever we
get any extra money for birthdays or anything; as
it is, you have only to get a little bracken from
the wood, and you can make yourself quite a nice
Feudal Castle bed. We would gather it for you,
only we simply must go home now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Or Aunt Grace will guess there’s something
up, and we shall get into a horrid row,’ put in
Micky, a remark which Emmeline thought neither
elegant nor suitable. There was no need for an
adopted child to know that its adopters were in
danger of getting into anything so undignified
as a ‘row.’</p>

<p>‘I aren’t going to stop here alone, not if it’s
ever so,’ said Diamond Jubilee, stubbornly.</p>

<p>His three adopters looked at one another in
dismay. What was to be done?</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright idea struck Micky.</p>

<p>‘Suppose I come back here to-night and sleep
with him?’ he suggested.</p>

<p>‘That’s absurd, Micky!’ answered Emmeline.
She felt terribly worried. ‘You would be found
out. Both the doors make such a horrible noise
when they are unbolted, and you can’t possibly go
before the house is shut up for the night, because
you know Aunt Grace always looks in the last
thing before she goes to bed.’</p>

<p>‘I could jump out of the schoolroom window,
as I did last time I had a naughty morning,’
rejoined Micky. ‘Naughty mornings’ were
recognised institutions with him, sad to say.</p>

<p>‘But how would you get in again to-morrow
morning?’ said Emmeline. ‘It wouldn’t do to
wait till the doors were unbolted, because you
must be back in bed before anyone is about.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, I shall swarm up the water-pipe, as I did
the other day. I shall manage all right’; and
his eyes sparkled with the delight of arranging
a real adventure.</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose that’s how it will have to be
settled, as Diamond Jubilee is such a great baby,’
said Emmeline reluctantly. ‘Anyhow, we really
must go home now, so you will just have to wait
here patiently, Diamond Jubilee, till Micky can
come back.’</p>

<p>‘Not if I know it,’ said Diamond Jubilee, who
as a town-bred boy felt terrors of the gathering
dusk in the lonely wood which stirred him to
unwonted resolution. ‘You’ll be giving me the
slip if I let you out of my sight.’</p>

<p>‘Ladies and gentlemen always keep their word,’
said Emmeline, with much dignity; ‘you needn’t
be afraid of Micky’s not coming back.’</p>

<p>‘I’m coming home along of you,’ said Diamond
Jubilee firmly; ‘then you can give me something
to eat. I’m about ready for it, I can
tell you.’</p>

<p>‘You’re <em>the</em> most unreasonable boy I ever met,’
said Emmeline, at the end of her patience. ‘You
can’t possibly come home with us. Aunt Grace
would be most awfully angry. And I think it’s
extremely greedy of you to want anything more
to eat after what you had at the shop.’</p>

<p>Emmeline herself had had one tea, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
just going home to another, but that, she felt, was
different.</p>

<p>‘I aren’t never going to stop alone in this here
wood,’ repeated Diamond Jubilee doggedly.</p>

<p>‘I know what!’ cried Kitty. ‘Let’s hide him
in the summer-house just for this evening. He’ll
be quite safe from being found, for no one goes
there except us, and he won’t be frightened if
he can see the lights from the windows. You’ll
like the summer-house, won’t you, Diamond
Jubilee?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t mind trying,’ said Diamond
Jubilee not ungraciously.</p>

<p>And so it had to be settled, though Emmeline
would have felt much easier in her mind if only
he would have stayed in the Feudal Castle, half a
mile away from Aunt Grace. However, there
was clearly no time for further argument; as it
was, they would have to put their best feet forward
if they were to reach home before it was suspiciously
late even for the 5.25 train. Diamond
Jubilee was certainly very trying.</p>

<p>Her heart softened to him again when they
reached their own garden, and he quite meekly
consented to go into hiding in the summer-house.
She had been half afraid that he might insist on
coming into the house with them in search of
something to eat, so it was a great relief that he
suddenly became so obedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, how have you enjoyed yourselves?’ was
Aunt Grace’s cheerful greeting, as the three children
came in on their return from Eastwich Fair.</p>

<p>‘Scrumptiously!’ said Micky; and then he and
Kitty went into raptures over the elephants and
the motor-cars, and cocoanuts Micky would have
hit if only something or other hadn’t always
just happened to prevent him.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace,’ broke in Emmeline presently,
‘I hope you don’t mind, but Mary had sprained
her ankle rather badly, so she couldn’t go to the
Fair, and—and I didn’t want to disappoint the
others, so as Mary felt sure we should really be all
right, we three went alone.’</p>

<p>Aunt Grace looked rather taken aback.</p>

<p>‘Well, it isn’t quite what I should have chosen
for you,’ she said, ‘but I’m sure you and Mary
settled what you thought was best. You’re a
good child to tell me about it so frankly,’ she
added kindly.</p>

<p>Emmeline felt a little uncomfortable. She did
not doubt that they were quite right in secretly
adopting Diamond Jubilee—people were obliged
sometimes to keep their good deeds secret from
unsympathetic relations—but perhaps she would
rather Aunt Grace had not chosen just that
moment to praise her for her frankness.</p>

<p>At tea that evening a most unusual thing happened:
Emmeline choked!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>If it had been Micky or Kitty there would have
been nothing at all strange in such a lapse, but
that Emmeline should do such a thing—Emmeline,
whose perfect table manners had been held up as
a model to the twins ever since they could remember—was
indeed a matter for surprise.</p>

<p>‘Was it a crumb?’ asked Aunt Grace, with
sympathy, when after vigorous pattings from the
delighted twins Emmeline had reached the stage
of being able to speak once more.</p>

<p>‘I—I don’t think so,’ mumbled Emmeline, with
what would have been a blush if her choking fit
had not left her too crimson already to turn even
a shade more so.</p>

<p>No, it had not been a crumb which had made
her choke in her tea, but the shock of seeing a
pale, grimy little face pressed close against the
window-pane outside. It had only been there for
an instant, but the sudden glimpse had almost
brought Emmeline’s heart into her mouth. She
felt as though she hardly knew how to sit still at
table when at any moment Diamond Jubilee might
look in again and be seen by Aunt Grace.</p>

<p>Oh dear, there was Micky asking for another
piece of bread and jam! However many more
was he going to have before she would be free to
get up and slip away to warn Diamond Jubilee?</p>

<p>‘Really, Micky, I think as this is your second
tea, and you’ll have supper before so very long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
you’ve had quite enough already,’ said Aunt Grace
to Emmeline’s great relief; ‘be quick and finish
what’s on your plate, Kitty, and then we’ll say
grace.’</p>

<p>As soon as they had risen from table Emmeline
hurried from the room, and rushed out into the
garden. She found Diamond Jubilee sitting in
the summer-house, looking as virtuous as though
he had never stirred out of it since they had left
him.</p>

<p>‘You really <em>must</em> be more careful,’ she panted.
‘It gave me a most awful turn just now to see
you looking in at the window.’</p>

<p>‘I ain’t never left this here shed,’ he assured
her in a voice of injured virtue.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Diamond Jubilee, that’s a story, for I saw
you!’ said Emmeline, shocked; ‘but I haven’t
time to stay and talk about it now, or they will be
missing me. Only promise me you won’t come
out again—you’re fairly safe in here, but anyone
might see you wandering about the garden. Do
you understand?’</p>

<p>‘I’m awful hungry,’ he grumbled.</p>

<p>‘Well, we’ll bring you some supper presently if
you will promise not to come out again,’ said
Emmeline. ‘Will you give me your word and
honour you won’t?’</p>

<p>He promised meekly enough, and she flew off
again. She had been so quick that she caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
up with the other children as they were going
upstairs to the schoolroom for their evening’s
preparation.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was safely closed she told
them what had happened. ‘I think he won’t do
it again after what I said,’ she concluded, ‘but it
gave me a good fright, I can tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose,’ said Micky, who did not see why
Emmeline should be the only one to make exciting,
secret expeditions to the summer-house,
‘suppose I was to creep down on tiptoe to the
dining-room and get some of that cake for Diamond
Jubilee? Jane won’t have begun to clear away
yet.’</p>

<p>‘No, certainly not,’ said Emmeline; ‘it would
be stealing to take Aunt Grace’s cake without her
leave and give it to Diamond Jubilee.’</p>

<p>Micky’s face fell. ‘I suppose it would,’ he
acknowledged; ‘I never thought of that.’</p>

<p>‘But poor Diamond Jubilee will get so hungry
if he doesn’t have anything more to eat till you
can buy him some food with the extra money-box
money,’ said Kitty, sadly.</p>

<p>‘But he won’t have to wait till then; I’ve
promised to take him some supper presently,’ said
Emmeline. ‘Our supper biscuits and milk are
our own to do what we like with, and I mean to
give him the milk to-night, and save the biscuits
for to-morrow morning’s breakfast. It’s a pity we
can’t save some of the milk too, but Jane would
notice if there weren’t three empty glasses.’</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">IT WAS LOCKED AND BOLTED, TOP AND BOTTOM.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I do wish Aunt Grace had let me have that
extra piece of bread and jam!’ said Micky. ‘I’m
sure I could have made room for it all right. Do
you think Diamond Jubilee will need quite all our
supper, Emmeline?’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure he will,’ said Emmeline, indignantly.
‘You’re a very selfish boy, Micky, to grudge poor
Diamond Jubilee anything you can give him.
How would you like to have only three biscuits
and three cups of milk for tea and supper and
breakfast put together? I count what he had in
the shop as dinner.’</p>

<p>Micky hung his head for a moment, then his
face suddenly grew bright with a pleasant idea.
‘I know!’ he cried. ‘We’ll pour some of the
milk into my tooth-glass, and it can be saved for
Diamond Jubilee’s breakfast. We can hide the
tooth-glass somewhere for the night. I wouldn’t
mind not brushing my teeth, not just for once,’ he
added hastily, as Emmeline’s face began to assume
its most elder-sisterly expression.</p>

<p>‘It would be for twice, to-night and to-morrow
morning,’ said Emmeline, severely. ‘I’m sometimes
afraid you’ll grow up into a disgusting person,
Micky, for you’re always trying to get out of
brushing your teeth!’</p>

<p>Micky muttered something about not caring if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
he did grow up into a disgusting person, which
Emmeline thought it more dignified not to hear.
‘Well, get on with your copies,’ she ordered, ‘else
we shan’t have done in time for Aunt Grace to
read to us.’</p>

<p>Silence settled down on the schoolroom—silence
which was broken suddenly by Kitty’s voice,
raised in its shrill, questioning key.</p>

<p>‘Are <em>we</em> guileless children?’ she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Sh—sh!’ said Emmeline, frowning. Her sum
was just at its most critical stage. It cancelled
out to one-third, and with a sigh of relief Emmeline
gave her mind to Kitty’s question. ‘What
made you think of it, Kitty?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Because of what Mary said this morning about
the wonderful things guileless children can do.
Is that why we are adopting Diamond Jubilee?’</p>

<p>‘We are adopting Diamond Jubilee so as to
save him from becoming a thief and burglar,’ said
Emmeline. ‘We are going to train him into a
good, noble man. I wonder if you two understand
what a great, beautiful work it is we have begun
to-day!’ Emmeline’s eyes shone with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Micky and Kitty looked greatly impressed and
elated. ‘Poor Diamond Jubilee!’ said Kitty, softly.
‘I’m so glad we can give him our supper.’</p>

<p>‘And I don’t mind much,’ said Micky, ‘and I’ll
train him first-rate—just you see if I don’t!’</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">DIAMOND JUBILEE’S SUPPER</span></h2>

<p>A tray on which were three glasses of cold milk
and three biscuits was always placed on the schoolroom
table punctually at eight o’clock, the twins’
bedtime. Emmeline, who was allowed to sit up
till a quarter to nine, usually let her supper wait
on the table till then; to-night, however, she
chose to retire with the younger ones.</p>

<p>‘She must be tired with the Fair and all the
excitement,’ thought Aunt Grace, little suspecting
all the plotting and planning that was going on at
that moment in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>‘The question is, how we are to get the milk
out to him without either Aunt Grace or the servants
hearing us,’ Emmeline was saying. ‘If we
go out at the side-door they’ll hear in the kitchen,
and if we go out at the front-door Aunt Grace
will hear in the drawing-room. I think on the
whole the side-door will be the safest, though, for
Aunt Grace has such awfully quick ears. But
either way it’s very risky.’</p>

<p>‘I know what!’ exclaimed Micky. ‘Do you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that American chap who was in a French
prison, and who kept his gaolers so amused with
his stories that the other people escaped while
they weren’t looking? Well, that’s what Kitty
and I will do. We’ll go to the kitchen and tell
Jane and Cook all the funniest stories we can
think of, and while they are laughing, Emmeline,
you can creep out on tiptoe with Diamond Jubilee’s
supper.</p>

<p>Emmeline felt a little doubtful as to whether
Micky’s stories would prove quite as absorbing as
the ‘American chap’s’ had done, but she could
not think of a better plan. ‘Very well,’ she said,
‘you go down to the kitchen now, and I’ll bring
down the supper in a minute or two, when you’ve
had time to get them interested.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Master Micky, it’s quite time you were
going to bed.’ Emmeline heard Jane’s voice saying,
as she crept past the kitchen-door two minutes
later. ‘We’re having our supper, and we don’t
want you and Miss Kitty bothering here now.’</p>

<p>‘But Jane, he’s going to tell you <em>such</em> a funny
story!’ pleaded Kitty.</p>

<p>‘It’s high time he was dreaming funny dreams
instead of telling funny stories,’ said Jane severely.
‘Go to bed now, Master Micky, there’s a good
boy.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to turn me out of the room then,
said Micky—a remark which was promptly followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
by sounds of a rush and scramble. Emmeline
knew that Micky was being chased round
and round the kitchen-table—a process which involved
far more noise than any amount of funny
stories. Decidedly Micky was a person of resource.</p>

<p>Emmeline put down her tray cautiously and
stretched out her hand to the door-handle.
Horrors! The wretched door would not open,
however much she turned the handle. It was
locked, and bolted top and bottom!</p>

<p>Emmeline was in despair. She would have to
fetch a chair in order to reach the top bolt, and it
was hopeless to think of doing this, unlocking and
unbolting the door, running out to Diamond
Jubilee and making him gulp down the milk,
coming back with the tray and the empty glasses,
rebolting and relocking the door, and taking away
the chair, all in the space of time that Micky was
being chased round the kitchen-table! No, clearly
there was nothing for it but just to go upstairs
again.</p>

<p>It was lucky that she decided as she did, for
she and her tray had barely disappeared up the
back stairs when the kitchen-door was flung open
and a very red-faced Micky was pushed out into
the passage.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell your aunt of you if you don’t go upstairs
this minute!’ Jane’s parting shot made the
little boy retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why, Emmeline, you <em>have</em> been quick!’ he
exclaimed, when he came back into the schoolroom
and found her there. ‘Oh, I see’—in a disappointed
voice, as he caught sight of the glasses
still full of milk—‘you haven’t even started.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have,’ and she ruefully explained what
had happened. ‘I can’t think what made Jane
take it into her head to lock up so early just this
one evening,’ she concluded. ‘She hardly ever
does it before they go to bed.’</p>

<p>‘She has put the shutters up in the dining-room,
too,’ remarked Micky. ‘I went in there
just now because I thought we might manage to
open the dining-room window and get the things
out that way.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think we could have opened that
window anyhow; it’s so very stiff and heavy,’ said
Emmeline; ‘and, of course, if the shutters are up
it’s no good thinking of it. Really, Jane is very
tiresome.’</p>

<p>‘She’s the annoyingest person I know,’ declared
Kitty in an aggrieved voice. ‘Micky was telling
her the loveliest story, and she wouldn’t listen—not
one little bit. It was awfully stupid of her—wasn’t
it, Emmeline?—besides being so unpolite.’</p>

<p>Emmeline was too much worried over the question
of Diamond Jubilee’s supper to give much
thought to Jane’s lack of manners.</p>

<p>‘What <em>are</em> we to do?’ she asked in despair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
‘It’s not only that he’ll be so hungry, but it’ll be
breaking a promise if we don’t take him some
supper.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll jump out of this window, and then you can
throw out the glasses for me to catch, like the
man at the circus,’ suggested Micky.</p>

<p>‘I dare say! And the glasses would all get
broken and the milk spilt,’ said Emmeline, dismissing
the idea with scorn. ‘But we might
throw the biscuits out like that. That’s what we’ll
have to do, I suppose, though it’s a great pity, as
we can’t save the milk for his breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve thought of a plan!’ cried Kitty suddenly;
and off she rushed, returning a moment later with
an empty hot-water can.</p>

<p>‘Whatever is the use of that?’ asked Emmeline,
quite puzzled.</p>

<p>‘It’ll be the lift for the glasses to go down in,’
explained Kitty, who was busy untying her sash.
‘My sash will be like the rope to let it down with.’</p>

<p>The story games at which they were constantly
playing had made them all very clever at putting
things to other uses than those for which they
were naturally intended, so both Micky and
Emmeline understood directly what Kitty meant.</p>

<p>‘It’s a splendid idea!’ said Emmeline warmly.</p>

<p>Kitty flushed with pleasure as she bent down,
and began tying one end of her sash in a knot
round the spout of the hot-water can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You’d better let me do that,’ said Micky
eagerly; ‘girls always make grannies.’ Sailor knots
were a new and carefully acquired accomplishment
to Micky himself, so it was with much satisfaction
that he undid Kitty’s rather feeble attempt,
and bound her sash with two beautiful knots, one
on the spout and the other on the handle of the
hot-water can. ‘There! That’ll do champion!’
he pronounced as he finished.</p>

<p>The next business was to put two of the glasses
and one of the biscuits into the hot-water can.
It had struck Emmeline while Micky was tying
his knots that they could, after all, save the contents
of the third glass for to-morrow morning’s
breakfast, since she and Kitty could use the same
tooth-glass just for once. That being so, one of
the biscuits might well be spared for to-night’s
supper.</p>

<p>As soon as the water-can lift was ready packed,
Micky clambered up on to the schoolroom window-sill
and jumped out, landing right on the top
of Mr. Brown’s favourite double chrysanthemum.
The poor plant did not like it at all, but
nobody paid any attention to it. Conspirators
cannot be expected to trouble about such trifles
as chrysanthemums, even if they <em>are</em> intended
for flower-shows.</p>

<p>Afterwards the can was slowly and carefully
lowered by Emmeline. Micky lifted up the lid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as soon as he had it safely in his hands, and all
three children were delighted when it turned
out that neither of the glasses had been upset
during their descent, and only a little of the
milk spilt.</p>

<p>‘I shall jump out, too, and help Micky take
Diamond Jubilee his supper,’ announced Kitty,
suddenly; and she was just preparing to do so
when Emmeline caught hold of her sleeve to stop
her, thereby letting drop the sash, which was her
only connecting-link with the can.</p>

<p>‘There now!’ she cried angrily. ‘See what
you’ve made me do by being so silly! It’ll all
be found out now, for I don’t know however
we are to get the can up again.’</p>

<p>‘I’m so dreadfully sorry, Emmeline,’ said poor
Kitty in a piteous voice.</p>

<p>She felt, as she told Micky afterwards, ‘a
mixture of a donkey and a traitor,’ and that is not
a cheery feeling.</p>

<p>Micky set the can down on the ground and
rubbed his head thoughtfully. He always did this
when he was perplexed, not because it helped
him, but because he had an impression that it was
the correct thing to do. Suddenly he bounded
like an excited indiarubber ball.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got it!’ he cried. ‘What donkeys we
are! All I’ll have to do is to untie the knots,
and roll the sash into a little ball to throw up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you; then you’ll have to let the two ends down,
and I’ll tie the knots again, and you’ll be able to
draw up the can as easy as easy. Do you
see?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes!’ said Emmeline in a tone of great
relief; ‘you are a good boy, Micky, to have
thought of that. But make haste now and take
Diamond Jubilee his supper; someone may come
in any moment. I’m sorry I was cross, Kitty,’
she added, as Micky flitted across the lawn at a
speed which was risky considering that he was
carrying two tumblers of milk, and disappeared
among the dark bushes round the summer-house,
‘but it was silly of you to think of jumping
down. However would you have got back again?
<em>You</em> couldn’t have swarmed up the water-pipe.’</p>

<p>‘I would have been able to if you hadn’t
stopped me practising the other day,’ said Kitty,
rather resentfully. It was her one grievance
that she was not always allowed to follow Micky
in his gymnastic feats. ‘When I’m grown up,’
she added, ‘I mean to have six daughters, and
all the lessons they shall do will be learning to
swarm up water-pipes!’</p>

<p>‘Hark! I do believe that’s someone coming!’
said Emmeline, looking frightened.</p>

<p>Footsteps were certainly mounting the back-stairs.
Nearer and nearer they came, and Emmeline’s
heart began to thump so hard that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
almost hear it. What if it should be Aunt Grace
herself?</p>

<p>The footsteps passed by the schoolroom door
without pausing, and Emmeline gave a gasp of
relief. If only Micky would make haste and
come back before someone really did come in!</p>

<p>‘You’d better go and undress, Kitty,’ she said
nervously. I must wait here to take in the can,
but there’s no need for you to stay, and if Aunt
Grace or Jane come in and find you still here they
will want to know why.’</p>

<p>It is hard to be ordered off to bed when one is
in the middle of such an exciting thing as a plot,
and poor Kitty looked so much disappointed
that Emmeline had to comfort her by telling her
to fetch her own tooth-glass to be filled with
milk and hidden for the night in the schoolroom
cupboard. That cheered her up again, and she
went off to bed contentedly enough afterwards.</p>

<p>Before she had been gone more than a minute
Micky and his empty tumblers returned.</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee’s a greedy pig,’ he said, as
he began fumbling with the knots.</p>

<p>‘People shouldn’t talk like that of their
adopted children,’ said Emmeline, ‘and do, do
make haste!’</p>

<p>‘Well, but he is,’ persisted Micky; ‘and I say,
Emmeline, I can’t undo these knots.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Micky, you <em>must</em> be able to undo your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
own knots!’ exclaimed Emmeline, almost in
tears.</p>

<p>‘Well, I can’t, then,’ said Micky, after a few
more desperate tugs, ‘and what’s more, it’s getting
so dark I can hardly see.’</p>

<p>‘What <em>is</em> to be done?’ cried poor Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘P’r’aps you could catch hold of the sash if I
toss up the middle,’ suggested Micky. They
tried, but of course in vain. ‘Well, I’ll just
have to wind it round my neck and swarm up
with it,’ said Micky, and Emmeline saw that
there was nothing else for it, though she felt
very uneasy as to the fate of the tumblers.</p>

<p>Her fears were only too well justified. Micky
found swarming up the water-pipe a far more
difficult feat in the twilight, and with a heavy
can almost throttling him, than it had been in
broad daylight without a can. Several times he
tried, and only slipped back panting to the ground.</p>

<p>‘I can’t do it with that beastly can,’ he declared
at last. ‘I’ll have to leave it behind a bush just
for to-night.’</p>

<p>‘But, Micky, Jane will come in and wonder
where the glasses are,’ said Emmeline in despair,
‘and then it will all be found out. Oh dear!
what <em>shall</em> we do?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ll put the glasses in my trouser pockets,’
said Micky cheerfully; ‘I think there’ll be room
if I turn out all the string and stuff.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It took a minute or two for Micky to turn
out all the ‘string and stuff’—under which
designation he included such various articles as
a broken pocket-knife, a half-eaten apple, odds
and ends of sealing-wax, a piece of very messy
toffee, marbles, old postage stamps, and crumbs
of yet older biscuits—and a minute or two more
to hide this and the can under a bush, and when
at last he and the glasses had begun their journey
up the water-pipe, it was not as prosperous
as might have been wished. It is true that
Micky, red, panting, and very dirty, did finally
reach the schoolroom window-sill in safety, but
this was not until after various adventures, in the
course of which one of the tumblers was smashed
to pieces, and the other rather badly cracked.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, I wish we had never tried to get the
milk out to Diamond Jubilee!’ sighed Emmeline,
‘if we had just taken him the biscuits it would have
been keeping my promise, but I did so want to
make a good impression this first evening!’</p>

<p>‘You haven’t made it, anyhow,’ said Micky,
‘he said he was still hungry even after he’d drunk
the two glasses of milk!’</p>

<p>‘You’re sure you took him the <em>two</em> glasses?’
asked Emmeline, with sudden suspicion. ‘You
didn’t drink some of it on the way, did you, Micky?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I didn’t,’ said Micky; ‘gentlemen
never drink their guest’s—I mean their adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
children’s—milk, and, besides, I don’t like milk
much. But I’m going to have a biscuit, anyhow.’</p>

<p>‘But, Micky, it’s just as bad for a gentleman to
eat his adopted child’s biscuit as to drink his milk,’
said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘No, it’s not; not when the gentleman’s been
swarming up water-pipes till he’s as hungry as
hungry,’ said Micky. ‘I tell you what, Emmeline,
if you’ll let me have the other two biscuits,
I’ll go and tell Aunt Grace I’m very sorry I’ve
had an accident and broken two of the glasses.
Then there won’t be any questions asked. Aunt
Grace is much too jolly to bother you with questions
when you go and tell of yourself.’</p>

<p>‘It doesn’t seem quite truthful, somehow,’ said
Emmeline. ‘She’ll think you’ve been dropping
the glasses on the floor or something like that.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I shan’t <em>say</em> so,’ said Micky stoutly,
‘and I did have an accident—several accidents.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it’s all right,’ said Emmeline, still
rather doubtfully; ‘and if you must have the
biscuits, you must, but it’s rather horrid of you,
Micky.’</p>

<p>‘No, it’s not horrid, it’s only hungry of me,’ said
Micky, calmly helping himself to a biscuit; ‘you
must remember I’ve got a long night before me.’</p>

<p>Micky did not have to go downstairs to make
his confession to Aunt Grace, for she appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the schoolroom while he was in the middle of his
second biscuit.</p>

<p>‘Why, Micky, you seem to be having a very
lengthy supper to-night,’ she remarked, in her
brisk, pleasant voice. ‘Do you know half-past
eight has struck? And what <em>has</em> been happening
to the glasses?’ she added, coming to the table
and examining them.</p>

<p>‘I’ve had—several accidents,’ stammered Micky,
turning red.</p>

<p>‘So it seems,’ said Aunt Grace rather dryly. ‘Is
it the accidents which have taken you so long?’</p>

<p>‘Partly,’ said Micky, turning still redder, and
looking so very uncomfortable that kind Aunt
Grace took pity on him.</p>

<p>‘Well, we won’t say any more about it this
once,’ she promised good-naturedly; ‘luckily, the
glasses are only the common sort. But I’m afraid
the next that gets broken you’ll have to pay for
out of your pocket-money unless there’s some
extra good reason for the accident. Do you see,
old man? And now make haste and go to bed,
for it’s shockingly late.’</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace,’ cried Micky, flinging himself
upon her and giving her one of his bear’s hugs,
‘you’re a—a ripper!’—a compliment which gratified
Aunt Grace as much as any she had ever received.</p>

<p>Emmeline watched them with her curious aloofness.
‘Pretty people like Aunt Grace can get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
round everybody,’ she was thinking bitterly.
‘Even the twins are beginning to love her more
than me!’</p>

<p>‘Good-night, Emmeline,’ said Aunt Grace, looking
at her niece rather wistfully. She would have
given a great deal for Emmeline to have hugged
her as Micky had just done.</p>

<p>‘Good-night,’ said Emmeline, in a voice which
sounded sulky, but was really unhappy, for
jealousy is the most miserable feeling that anyone
can have, except perhaps sea-sickness.</p>

<p>When Emmeline went to her room she found
Kitty already in bed. Her eyes were shining
with excitement. ‘Has Micky got back safe, and
did Diamond Jubilee like his supper?’ she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know—I don’t think he said,’ answered
Emmeline, absently.</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ continued Kitty, ‘I feel as if
I’d had ten birthdays all in a lump to-day, and was
a big grown-up woman of eighteen; for adopting
somebody is an awfully grown-up thing to do,
isn’t it, Emmeline?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ assented Emmeline, with a brightening
face.</p>

<p>There was one person, at all events, who could
never forsake her for Aunt Grace; Diamond
Jubilee, at least, would never forget the one who
had rescued him from a life of sin and misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Under her gentle guidance he would grow into a
very, very good man—perhaps even a clergyman
or a missionary. Some day he would address a
meeting like the one the other night, only much
larger, and he would tell the story of his own life.
‘But for that child who rescued me when I was a
ragged little boy, being brought up as a pickpocket,
I might ere this have ended my life on the
gallows,’ he would say, in a voice which would
tremble with emotion. Emmeline could not quite
make up her mind whether she herself would be
present at this interesting meeting, or whether she
would by that time be lying in a quiet grave,
covered with the wreaths of white lilies which
Diamond Jubilee would order, regardless of expense.
On the whole she inclined to the latter
alternative.</p>

<p>That night, as Aunt Grace brushed her hair,
she was thinking of the twins, and what dear,
merry little souls they were. ‘And Emmeline’s a
splendid little person, too,’ she told herself loyally;
she was always afraid of making a distinction,
even in thought, between her love for the twins
and her love for Emmeline. ‘How few children
of her age could be safely trusted to take a
younger brother and sister to a fair! It was odd
of Mary to let them go, but I suppose it was out
of her great good-nature and fear of disappointing
them, and, after all, I suppose in her own circle it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
would seem quite a suitable arrangement that a
little elder sister should take the younger ones.
Well, anyhow, no harm has come of it.’</p>

<p>Perhaps Aunt Grace would have been less sure
that no harm had come of it if she could have
guessed that at that very moment Micky had
jumped out of the schoolroom window, preparatory
to spending the night with the disreputable little
ragamuffin whom Emmeline had picked up at the
fair.</p>

<p>‘Are you all right, Micky?’ Emmeline was
asking anxiously. ‘Are you ready to have the
blankets thrown out?’</p>

<p>The idea of taking the blankets from the
unused spare-room bed had been a really brilliant
inspiration.</p>

<p>‘Right as a trivet,’ said Micky, in a voice which,
though cheery, was prudently subdued; ‘the bed’s
so jolly soft. Yes, throw them out now. Well,
if this isn’t the greatest lark!’</p>

<p>The moon was very bright, so that Emmeline
and Kitty were able to watch the tangle of
blankets and boy tottering across the lawn. Then
it disappeared among the dark bushes, and the
two girls crept back to their beds as quietly as
they had left them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">BAD NEWS</span></h2>

<p>Emmeline awoke next morning with the cares
of the mother of a family weighing on her mind.
Yesterday, amid the excitement of adopting Diamond
Jubilee and of the various adventures which
had followed, she had hardly had leisure to realise
all the difficulties and anxieties the carrying out of
her plan would involve; but now that the first
flush of romance was beginning to fade into the
light of common day, they stood out with unpleasant
clearness. What if Diamond Jubilee
should go on refusing to live alone in the Feudal
Castle? For one evening he might be fairly
safe from discovery in the summer-house; for one
night Micky might go out and sleep in the wood
without anyone becoming aware of his absence;
but Emmeline had sense enough to see that such
arrangements could not possibly be lasting. Even
for once they were very risky. Suppose Micky
should fail to come back before Jane went to
call him?</p>

<p>She felt under her pillow for her little gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
watch. It was a quarter to seven; in another
half-hour it would be time to get up, and Jane
would come to call them. What a hue and cry
would be raised if Micky were missing!</p>

<p>A restless feeling seized her that she must get
up then and there and go to see whether he was
safe in his bed; so she scrambled into her
dressing-gown and slippers, and hurried out of
the room and down the passage and steps which
led to the old part of the house. Her knees
shook as she opened Micky’s door and crept in.
Suppose the bed should be empty?</p>

<p>Joy! Micky was lying there, so sound asleep
that she could almost have believed the adventures
of the night before only a dream, had it
not been for the mud on his house-shoes, which
were lying in the middle of the floor mixed up
with a heap of his other clothes, all evidently
left just as he had got out of them on his return.</p>

<p>‘It must have been raining in the night, for
there was no mud yesterday evening,’ thought
Emmeline, as she folded the clothes and put
them neatly on a chair, under which she placed
the shoes. She was a tidy child by nature, and
besides, as she reflected, Jane was much less
likely to notice that the shoes were muddy, if they
were in the right place.</p>

<p>She went back to her own room feeling much
easier in her mind. For that time, at all events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the danger was over, and surely the very fact
that Micky was lying there so peacefully gave
good hope that it would not again be necessary to
run such a risk. Micky could never have gone to
sleep so calmly if Diamond Jubilee had been in a
great state of distress at being left alone in the
Feudal Castle. So, at least, Emmeline told herself
and tried to believe.</p>

<p>Several times, while the little girls were dressing,
and while Kitty, who had all the delight of being
in a plot without the anxieties of responsibility,
was pouring out a constant stream of excited
chatter, Emmeline looked nervously out of the
window, half expecting to see Diamond Jubilee
lurking somewhere about the garden. There was
never any sign of him, however, and her spirits
rose higher each moment. If only he were settling
down to live happily in the Feudal Castle, everything
would be more simple!</p>

<p>‘I can’t think what can have happened to
Micky,’ remarked Aunt Grace, as they were
beginning breakfast that morning without his
having made an appearance; ‘it’s not often he
oversleeps himself. I’m afraid the Fair has
been too much for you young people,’ she added,
in a playfully teasing voice, as Kitty gave a great
yawn.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s not that,’ began Kitty, eager to defend
the Fair; ‘I think it’s——’ Here she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
suddenly aware of Emmeline’s frowns, and broke
off with reddening cheeks. What a scolding she
would have from Emmeline presently!</p>

<p>Fortunately for Kitty, Aunt Grace was not
attending. She was reading a letter which
seemed to contain bad news, for her expression
grew more and more distressed. She read it over
twice, as though hoping against hope that she
might have made some mistake, and when she
laid it down Emmeline saw that her hands were
shaking.</p>

<p>‘I’ve just had a piece of very bad news,’ she
said quietly. ‘Mary King—the very dear friend
I used to live with in London—is dangerously
ill—dying, I’m afraid. I shall have to go to her
to-day or—— Kitty, would you mind fetching
Bradshaw? It’s on the drawing-room writing-table.’</p>

<p>Kitty bustled off, awestruck and yet pleased
with the importance of being able to help at such
a crisis, if only by fetching Bradshaw.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, it’s last month’s—I was forgetting,’
said Aunt Grace wearily, as Kitty came running
back with it. ‘I suppose it wouldn’t be safe to
trust to it—so many trains change in September.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose I go out and buy another?’ suggested
Kitty, eagerly. To be sent out shopping in the
middle of breakfast would be a delightful break in
the ordinary routine of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t get one at any of the village
shops,’ said Aunt Grace, putting her hand to her
forehead. ‘Stay! the Robinsons might possibly
have one.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll run round to the Vicarage and ask them,’
broke in Kitty, rushing off almost before Aunt
Grace had time for the absent ‘Very well,’ which
was all she answered.</p>

<p>‘I’ll just go and see that she puts on a hat,’
murmured Emmeline, more to herself than to
Aunt Grace who had no ears for such things just
then. The precaution proved a necessary one.
Emmeline was only just in time to stop Kitty from
running out at the front door hatless, gloveless,
and still in her morning pinafore, a garment
which had seen much active service in the course
of its career.</p>

<p>Micky was coming downstairs by way of the
banisters when Emmeline made her way back
to the dining-room. ‘I say, is Aunt Grace in a
wax?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘What about?’ asked Emmeline. ‘Oh, because
of your being late for breakfast? No, I expect
she has forgotten all about you. She’s just heard
that her dearest friend is dying.’</p>

<p>Micky’s round, impudent face suddenly fell,
and he was so much awestruck that he had got
to the dining-room door before it occurred to him
to make any remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>When the two children came into the room
Aunt Grace was sitting very still, gazing straight
in front of her, with eyes that did not seem to be
seeing anything. Without saying a word Micky
went straight up to her and gave her a rough
hug.</p>

<p>‘My own boy!’ she murmured, a little absently,
but very tenderly, as she stroked his ruffled head—Micky’s
toilet that morning had left much to
be desired—and seemed to find a certain comfort
in the touch. Emmeline suddenly felt a queer lump
rising in her throat. Kitty could run messages
for Aunt Grace, and Micky could comfort her;
she alone could do nothing.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you try and eat something, Aunt Grace?’
she suggested, shyly, after a moment. ‘Let me
butter some toast for you.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Emmeline,’ said Aunt Grace,
gratefully; and though she had no appetite for
food just then, she made a brave effort to eat the
toast so as not to disappoint the child, and the
little kindness given and received brought them
nearer together than ever before.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know Miss King was ill, even,’ Emmeline
ventured, timidly. ‘It’s very sudden, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘In a sense, yes,’ said Aunt Grace sadly; ‘but
she has known, and I have known for a long time
past, that she had this disease, and that the end
might come at any time. That was why I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
on living with her in London till her sister could
return from India, instead of coming at once to
look after you, as I should naturally have done.
She would have let me go, poor darling, for she
never thought of herself. But I just couldn’t
leave her alone, knowing that all this suffering
and danger might come on at any time.’</p>

<p>It was the first time that Aunt Grace had talked
to Emmeline so much as she would have done to
a grown-up person, and the little girl listened
with a strange mixture of feelings, among which
gratification, perplexity, and self-reproach came
uppermost. She had hitherto always taken for
granted that Aunt Grace had stayed in London
because she was absorbed in a round of gaiety,
and now that the real reason appeared to have
been such a very different one, she found her
whole point of view shifting in a disconcerting
fashion. Could it be that Aunt Grace was really
a quite different kind of person from what Emmeline
had always imagined her?</p>

<p>There was little time for considering the question,
for just at that moment Alice came in with
a telegram. ‘It’s just as I feared from the letter,’
said Aunt Grace, after she had torn it open with
trembling fingers. ‘All the worst symptoms are
confirmed. I shall have to start by the next train,’
and with that she hurried away to pack and to
give a few hasty directions to the servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Can’t I help you, Aunt Grace?’ asked Emmeline,
running after her.</p>

<p>‘Well, will you look after Micky’s breakfast,
and Kitty’s too, when she comes back?’ said Aunt
Grace, with a faint smile. ‘That will help me
more than anything.’</p>

<p>Sympathy had by no means dulled the edge of
Micky’s appetite, and he was still in the middle of
a leisurely breakfast when Kitty burst in, followed
rather more quietly by Mr. Faulkner. ‘Aunt
Grace—where’s Aunt Grace?’ she demanded,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to London to-day myself, so I want
your aunt to let me travel with her and help her
all I can,’ explained Mr. Faulkner to Emmeline,
as Kitty ran away to look for Aunt Grace.</p>

<p>‘Thank you; I’m sure she’ll be very glad,’ said
Emmeline, in her best grown-up manner. ‘Won’t
you sit down and let me pour you out a cup of
tea?’</p>

<p>‘Thanks very much, but I’ve had breakfast
already,’ said Mr. Faulkner; and just at that
moment Aunt Grace herself came in, with Kitty.</p>

<p>Mr. Faulkner did not wait to say ‘How do you
do?’ Instead, he began at once: ‘You’ll let me
travel with you, won’t you?’ not at all as if he was
proposing a kindness, but in the way people ask
for something they want very much.</p>

<p>‘Thank you! I shall be very glad,’ said Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Grace, and for one moment she smiled—smiled
more with her eyes than with her lips, even though
her eyes were full of tears. Emmeline felt in a
vague, wondering way that Mr. Faulkner’s suggestion
had comforted Aunt Grace more than her
toast, or Kitty’s eagerness in running messages,
or even Micky’s hug. It was odd, she thought,
for Aunt Grace did not seem a person who would
mind travelling alone.</p>

<p>He went away again almost directly afterwards,
and there followed a time of general bustle and
confusion. ‘It’s a pity we can’t take Diamond
Jubilee his breakfast now,’ remarked Emmeline,
chancing to find herself alone with the twins. ‘It
would be quite easy to get it out of the house
without anyone noticing while they’re all so busy;
but it’s such a long way to the Feudal Castle that
I’m afraid it would be lesson-time before we could
get back.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but he isn’t at the Feudal Castle,’ said
Micky calmly. ‘I believe he’d be in the summer-house
still if I hadn’t told him he must jolly
well get out if he didn’t want me to lick him. I
expect he’s hanging about somewhere near the
garden.’</p>

<p>‘Micky, you surely didn’t sleep in the summer-house?’
asked Emmeline, in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>Micky nodded.</p>

<p>‘You couldn’t expect us to lug those beastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
blankets all the way to the Feudal Castle,’
he said.</p>

<p>‘But, Micky, it was really risky,’ said Emmeline.
‘Just supposing Mr. Brown had found
you!’</p>

<p>‘Well, he didn’t, anyhow,’ said Micky, ‘and
it wasn’t likely he would; nobody hardly ever
goes there except us. It was really much safer
than if we had gone to the Feudal Castle. How
would I ever have known when it was time to
come back, in the middle of the wood?’</p>

<p>There was something in this, but still Emmeline
could not help feeling that it had been a risk, and
a risk that Diamond Jubilee must not again be
allowed to run. Then, as a fresh idea suddenly
struck her, ‘What about the blankets?’ she
gasped—‘you haven’t surely left them——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, they’re as safe as safe,’ Micky reassured
her. ‘I thought of a simply lovely place to keep
them—Punch’s kennel!’</p>

<p>‘But they’ll be seen as soon as ever Punch is
unchained!’ said Emmeline, in a panic. ‘Oh, how
could you be so silly?’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t silly,’ said Micky. ‘I pushed them
right to the back of the kennel, where it’s all dark.
Nobody would ever see them unless they stooped
down and looked right in, and they’d never think
of doing that.’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Emmeline doubtfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
‘but I’m afraid they’ll be very dirty and smelly
when they come out again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, they’ll only smell rather doggy,’ said
Micky cheerfully.</p>

<p>It struck Emmeline that Jane might not take it
quite so calmly as Micky, if next time she went to
prepare the spare-room for a visitor she found the
best blankets smelling doggy. Still, it was to be
hoped that next time was still a long way off, and
meantime the kennel had one advantage as a
storing-place—namely, that it would be possible
to take the blankets out of it without being
observed. Perhaps, after all, Micky had done
the best that could be done under the circumstances.
Emmeline felt quite bewildered with
the new and unthought of difficulties and problems
which were continually cropping up. She
had never realised that the secret adoption of a
child would prove so complicated a business.</p>

<p>‘Well, I think I’ll go out with the milk and see
if I can find him,’ she said aloud, after a moment’s
anxious reflection. ‘Even if I don’t I can always
leave it in some safe outdoor place. Don’t either
of you come with me. Aunt Grace may want us
to go messages, and it would be awkward if you
were out as well.’</p>

<p>Emmeline ran up to the schoolroom, took the
glass of milk out of the cupboard, and hurried
downstairs with it. When she had got it safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
into the garden without anyone having noticed
her, she began to breathe freely again.</p>

<p>Alas! An unforeseen danger was following
her down the garden path. She had been thinking
so much of escaping with her milk, unseen by
Jane, Cook, or Aunt Grace, that she had forgotten
all about Mr. Brown till now, when she heard his
wheel-barrow grating on the gravel behind her.
It was a dismaying sound, for Mr. Brown had
inconveniently keen eyes, and if he saw the milk
he would certainly wonder what she was doing
with it out there. What was worse, he would
wonder about it to Jane and Cook, for Mr.
Brown’s standard of honour in not telling tales
was not as high as it might have been. So
Emmeline almost ran along the path, without
daring so much as to look round, and, pushing
open the garden door, fled through it and into the
lane so hastily that a good deal of her milk
splashed out on to her dress.</p>

<p>‘Hello!’ called a voice, as she was trying,
without much success, to rub out the stain with
her pocket-handkerchief. Looking up, startled,
she saw Diamond Jubilee’s disreputable little
figure leaning over the railings which fenced off
the wood.</p>

<p>‘You should say “Good-morning,” not
“Hulloa,”’ said Emmeline with dignity, as soon
as she had recovered from her start. ‘See, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
have brought you your breakfast. Drink it
quickly, for I have to get back to—to my work.’
She had been on the point of saying ‘to lessons,’
but ‘work’ sounded more dignified.</p>

<p>‘Why, I reckoned you was a lady,’ said Diamond
Jubilee, pausing between two gulps to give
her one of his critical stares.</p>

<p>‘Well, so I am,’ said Emmeline, perplexed and
a little offended.</p>

<p>‘Ladies don’t do no work,’ said the boy.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, they do,’ said Emmeline earnestly.
‘Everybody that’s worth anything does work.
Why, even the Prince of Wales has “I serve”
for his motto. That’s one of the things I’ll
have to teach you, Diamond Jubilee, that you
can’t be a real gentleman unless you work for
other people.’</p>

<p>‘My father were a gentleman more often than
not,’ remarked Diamond Jubilee, wiping his
mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>It struck Emmeline that she must certainly
buy him one or two pocket-handkerchiefs. To
be sure, he needed an entire new outfit, for what
he had on was only fit for a bonfire, but her
present means would, alas! only run to absolute
necessities, such as food and pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, you must try to follow your
father’s example,’ she said aloud. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
know that to be ‘a gentleman’ in Diamond
Jubilee’s sense meant to be out of work.
‘Think how it would have grieved him if he could
have seen you yesterday afternoon trying to steal
my purse! You must always be a good boy, for
his sake.’</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, the late Mr. Jones had
frequently varied his periods of being a gentleman
with times in prison, for he had combined a strong
turn for petty crime with a distinct talent for being
found out, so it was no wonder that his son stared
at Emmeline in vacant surprise. He was never a
boy who troubled himself much to understand
puzzling things, however, so he passed on to a
subject of more practical importance.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you going to give me nothing more to
eat?’ he demanded, with a return to his professional
whine. ‘That ain’t much of a breakfast,
that aren’t.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know, Diamond Jubilee, I’m afraid
you’re rather greedy?’ said Emmeline. ‘You
oughtn’t to want anything more after that glassful
of good milk. I’m sure it’s more than what you’ve
been used to having for breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that aren’t, then,’ said Diamond
Jubilee sulkily. ‘I’m used to a meat breakfast,
I am.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid that’s a story,’ said Emmeline,
gravely, ‘and it’s very wicked to tell stories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
besides being silly, for you might know I shouldn’t
believe anything so absurd.’</p>

<p>Emmeline spoke out of the wisdom she had
gained from her little story-books, in which ragged
street-urchins were always pictured as breakfasting
on dry bread—if, indeed, they had any breakfast
at all. But, as a matter of fact, Diamond Jubilee’s
statement was not altogether without foundation.
There had been times in Mother Grimes’ establishment
when money became mysteriously plentiful,
and at such times she and Diamond Jubilee
and the other little boys who lived with her, had
fared with reckless luxury till the last penny had
been spent. To be sure, there had been other
times when they had really had almost as little to
eat as Emmeline imagined—indeed, they had
been passing through one of those uncomfortable
intervals just lately, which accounted for Diamond
Jubilee’s willingness to let himself be adopted—but
the memory of that and all the other disagreeables
of his former life was fast losing its
vividness.</p>

<p>‘I did used to have meat breakfasts,’ he repeated
stubbornly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you,’ said Emmeline, severely.
‘But I haven’t time to talk about that just now.
What I wanted to say was to tell you how vexed
I am to hear that you spent last night in the
summer-house. Why, just suppose Mr. Brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had found you there when he came to work this
morning! There would have been a dreadful
fuss, and you would have been sent back to Mother
Grimes!’</p>

<p>‘And do you reckon I’d mind that?’ he asked,
scornfully. ‘I’d a deal sooner be with her than
with you, I can tell you.’</p>

<p>Emmeline took this for mere bravado, but she
turned rather white, none the less, and it was with
an effort that she recovered herself and said
gently: ‘I don’t think you mean that. Anyhow,
I hope you’ll try and be a brave boy to-night, and
not make a fuss about sleeping in your own little
house. It’s true it <em>is</em> rather bare just at present,
but think how many poor little boys have no house
at all to sleep in.’</p>

<p>‘Lor! how she do jaw!’ exclaimed Diamond
Jubilee, with a rude laugh.</p>

<p>If Emmeline had been white a minute before,
she turned crimson now.</p>

<p>‘You are a very naughty, ungrateful boy!’ she
cried, as the tears rushed to her eyes, ‘and I’m
not going to waste any more time bothering about
you. Give me that glass, please,’ and, having
snatched it out of his hands, she ran across the
lane into their own garden, feeling more hurt and
angry than she had ever done in her life before.</p>

<p>She calmed down a little after she had rushed
upstairs to her own room and rinsed out the glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and by the time she had dabbed her eyes with a
wet sponge and dried them with a towel, she had
almost forgiven Diamond Jubilee.</p>

<p>‘After all, it only shows how badly he needs
someone to teach him better,’ she told herself,
bravely, ‘so I must try to be patient with him,
poor boy! But, oh dear, I wonder whether
Kathleen ever found those children whom she
was an angel to, so trying?’</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">OMNIBUS NUTS</span></h2>

<p>‘I’m sure people’s adopted children matter much
more than their stupid French exercises!’ wailed
Kitty. Her own French exercise had been so
very stupid that Miss Miller had sentenced her
to stay in after lessons and write it over again;
and now Emmeline had announced her intention
of going into the village to buy Diamond Jubilee’s
food-supply. It was really too hard, Kitty felt, to
be kept in to-day of all days.</p>

<p>‘Leave the old thing,’ suggested Micky; ‘very
likely she’ll forget to ask for it to-morrow as she
did for my declension.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t—she put me on my honour,’ said Kitty,
kicking the table-leg angrily.</p>

<p>‘Putting people on their honour is a horridly
mean dodge,’ growled Micky.</p>

<p>‘I wonder whether, when people wanted to go
lovely secret expeditions to take food to Prince
Charlie, they ever had to do stupid exercises
instead?’ said Kitty, giving another vicious kick
to the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Emmeline entered, in hat and
gloves. ‘I’ve taken the extra money-box money,’
she told them, breathlessly; ‘it’s two shillings and
ninepence. That ought to last him nearly three
weeks. About a shilling a week is all we can
reckon on, I’m afraid, though it doesn’t seem
much even for Omnibus Nuts. To be sure, there’s
birthday money, but that won’t be yet, and even
when we get it, it will be wanted for bedclothes
and things. If only we could earn some more,
somehow!’</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee shall have all my egg-money,’
said Kitty eagerly. She had a little family of
bantams, and was allowed to sell the eggs to the
cook.</p>

<p>‘But there have been hardly any eggs lately,’
said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘There’s only one hen now Whitey’s dead,’ said
Kitty, rather injured. ‘I’m sure Specky does her
best. It’s such a pity that last set of eggs Whitey
hatched all turned out gentlemen. If only they
had been ladies we might have had heaps of eggs.’</p>

<p>‘What are Omnibus Nuts, Emmeline?’ asked
Micky five minutes later, as they were ‘ralking’ to
the village. (‘Ralking’ was a word of their own used
to describe a peculiar cross between walking and
running, specially invented by Micky for occasions
like coming back from Church, when running was
forbidden.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, they’re a wonderful new food that’s just
been invented, and that’s ever so much cheaper
than any of the ordinary foods. A person could
manage to live on them for ninepence a week, it
says,’ explained Emmeline. ‘They’re called
Omnibus Nuts because they contain all the things
which are of use in all the other foods we eat. I
read all about them in that <em>Vegetarian Magazine</em>
which came the other day. I think Diamond
Jubilee ought really to do quite well if he has
nine-pennyworth of Omnibus Nuts every week,
and three-pennyworth of chocolate, which everyone
says is about the most nourishing thing you
can eat.’</p>

<p>‘Well, the chocolate will be decent, anyway,’
said Micky, with conviction.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour’s ‘ralking’ brought them
into the village.</p>

<p>‘Omnibus Nuts?’ said Mrs. Freeman, the fat
and rather aggressive woman who kept the shop
which supplied the Woodsleigh people with the
less interesting wants of life—for exciting things
like Christmas dinners or new hats they usually
went into Eastwich—‘no, we don’t keep them.
What’s more, I never heard tell of them.’</p>

<p>Emmeline’s face fell. According to the advertisement,
all England was munching Omnibus
Nuts; it was very tiresome of Woodsleigh to be
the one exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>‘How long would it take you to order them for
us?’ she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘There’s the carrier coming from Eastwich to-morrow,
but you’d not get such things there, I
don’t suppose, and it wouldn’t be worth our while
to order them special from London, not the little
quantity you’d want. I suppose it isn’t Miss
Bolton who’s ordering them, by the way?’</p>

<p>‘No, but we shall want a very large quantity,’
said Emmeline, drawing herself up—‘nine-pennyworth
every week.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ chimed in Micky, ‘we shall want a quite
enormous quantity—somebody’s going to live just
on Omnibus Nuts and chocolate.’</p>

<p>‘Well I never!’ ejaculated Mrs. Freeman,
while Emmeline frowned and pressed Micky’s
foot hard.</p>

<p>‘Well, can you order them for us?’ she asked
hastily, hoping by a return to more formal
business relations to avert suspicions.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know, I’m sure,’ said Mrs. Freeman,
eyeing her customers doubtfully. ‘You
see, we should have to order them special from
London.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose you would,’ said Emmeline,
impatiently; ‘you’d be almost sure to get them
in Eastwich. Besides, once you’d got them in
stock, everybody in the village would be buying
them—they’re like meat, and milk, and vegetables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
all put together, it says, and they don’t cost hardly
anything, and there’s no need to cook them.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman looked stolidly incredulous, and
Emmeline was fast losing what remained of her
temper, when there came an unexpected interruption.
A bright-looking youth suddenly poked
his head out of the half-open door which divided
the shop from an inner room, and joined in the
conversation.</p>

<p>‘So you want Omnibus Nuts?’ he said. ‘Wonderful
things! I know them well. Pity they’re
out of stock. Still, a famous specialist has just
discovered that monkey-nuts have exactly the
same nutritious properties. Wouldn’t you like
some of them?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman abruptly turned her back on the
children, and Emmeline, who could not see her
grin, was much impressed by the young man’s
long words and confident air.</p>

<p>‘You’re <em>quite</em> sure they’re as good as Omnibus
Nuts?’ she asked, with only a slight touch of
doubt in her voice. ‘They would really do instead
of meat and vegetable and all the other things?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve lived on them myself for six weeks
together, and felt as chirpy as could be at the end
of the time,’ said the young man, gravely.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I think they <em>must</em> be all right,’ decided
Emmeline, with a sigh of relief ‘so we’ll
take some, please.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The last part of Emmeline’s sentence was
addressed to Mrs. Freeman, but that lady had
become suddenly and unaccountably busy with
something in a dark corner of the shop, and it was
the youth who came forward to serve them.</p>

<p>‘What quantity would you like?’ he asked,
politely.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ began Emmeline, ‘I meant to have
spent two-and-threepence on the Omnibus Nuts.’</p>

<p>‘You shall have our entire stock of monkey-nuts
for two-and-threepence,’ said the young man,
promptly. ‘It comes cheaper buying them in large
quantities, you know; but, of course, we can sell
you a smaller amount if you prefer.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I think we’ll take them all. I know it
comes cheaper in the long run,’ said Emmeline,
feeling herself quite an experienced housekeeper.</p>

<p>She had often heard grown-up people talk of
things being cheaper in the long run.</p>

<p>‘Shall we send them for you?’ asked the young
man, as he reached down the jar containing the
monkey-nuts.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, we’ll take them with us, please,’ said
Emmeline hastily.</p>

<p>‘I’ll make two parcels of them then. They’d
be rather a lot for one to carry. Now, is there
anything else we can do for you, to-day?’ he
added, as he poured out the monkey-nuts into
two large, stout paper-bags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’ll have sixpennyworth of milk-chocolate
please,’ said Emmeline. ‘I suppose it <em>is</em> more
nourishing than plain chocolate?’</p>

<p>‘Most nourishing thing you can eat next to
monkey-nuts, and, of course, Omnibus Nuts,’ said
the youth cheerfully, as he served her with it.</p>

<p>‘George Albert, I’m ashamed of you—telling
such crams!’ exclaimed Mrs. Freeman, as soon as
the children had left the shop.</p>

<p>‘It was all in the way of business,’ said George
Albert, ‘and I dare say monkey-nuts will do
every bit as well as Omnibus Nuts, whatever they
may be.’</p>

<p>Emmeline meantime gave Micky a little lecture
as they walked away from the shop.</p>

<p>‘I do wish you would be more careful,’ she was
saying. ‘You very nearly let out about Diamond
Jubilee just now.’</p>

<p>‘I never said his name even,’ said Micky indignantly;
‘I’ve been most frightfully careful.’</p>

<p>‘You said quite enough to let out, if anyone
had been paying much attention,’ said Emmeline,
severely. ‘Luckily Mrs. Freeman seemed
thoroughly stupid, but I don’t feel sure that
sharp young man mayn’t have guessed something.’</p>

<p>Micky thought it as well to change the subject.</p>

<p>‘We seem to have got a great many monkey-nuts
for one boy,’ he remarked, peering into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
bag. ‘Don’t you think he’ll get rather tired of
them before they’re done?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, Micky. What silly ideas you have!’
said Emmeline impatiently. ‘You must remember
that Diamond Jubilee isn’t like us. I
expect he’s often been used to going days and days
without the least little scrap of food; so he ought
to be only too thankful to have plenty of nice,
nourishing monkey-nuts.’</p>

<p>They had got well outside the village, and were
just passing a farm famous for its apple-orchard,
when Emmeline was startled, and Micky interested,
by sounds of wrath and battle.</p>

<p>‘Get out, you young varmint!’ shouted an angry
voice; ‘and if ever I catch you in my orchard
again I’ll give you such a warming——’</p>

<p>Emmeline lost the rest of the sentence in her
fright and dismay at being almost knocked down
by a ragged, dirty, and altogether disreputable
little tramp, who rushed out into the road looking
the very picture of guilt.</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee!!!!!!’ she gasped, with
at least six notes of horror in her voice, but terror
of the promised warming had lent wings to Diamond
Jubilee’s usually laggard feet, and he flew
past her quite unheeding. He never once stopped
till forty good yards lay between himself and the
farm; then he turned round, and after making
quite sure that he was not being pursued, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
vent to language which it was just as well Micky
and Emmeline were too far off to catch. As it
was they merely got the benefit of the eloquent
gesture—a favourite one in Diamond Jubilee’s
circle—by which he expressed his utter and unspeakable
contempt for the farmer.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was then for the first time that Emmeline
fully realised the appalling amount of training
her adopted son would need before he would
be at all a satisfactory missionary.</p>

<p>‘Micky, he’s a <em>dreadful</em> little boy!’ she
gasped.</p>

<p>Indignation caused her to quicken her pace,
and as Diamond Jubilee, now no longer in fear of
pursuit, was sauntering along like the proverbial
snail, they soon overtook him. He greeted them
with a cool ‘Hello!’</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee, I can’t tell you how ashamed
and grieved I am,’ began Emmeline, in the voice
which she considered suitable to a sorrow-stricken
and virtuous parent addressing an unworthy child.</p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee gave her an impudent stare.</p>

<p>‘Garn!’ he said. ‘What are you getting at
me for?’</p>

<p>‘I’m much too upset to “get” at you as you
call it,’ said Emmeline, sorrowfully. ‘To think of
<em>you</em> robbing an orchard, Diamond Jubilee, and
after all I said to you this morning, too!’</p>

<p>It is painful to have to relate what followed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as this is a true history of Diamond Jubilee Jones
and of Micky, his adopted father, the regrettable
incident cannot be shirked. Instead of being
moved to penitence by Emmeline’s appeal,
Diamond Jubilee’s only answer was to jerk his
forefinger and thumb into a repetition of his former
gesture, only this time it was pointed not towards
the farm, but at Emmeline herself.</p>

<p>The sight was too much for Micky’s sense of
chivalry.</p>

<p>‘I’ll teach you to cheek my sister!’ he shouted,
flinging down his bag of nuts and rushing at
Diamond Jubilee with doubled fists. ‘You little
beast, you!’</p>

<p>Now Diamond Jubilee, though older and a
trifle taller than Micky, was in nothing like as
good form. Moreover, his recent visit to the apple-orchard
had been a bad preparation for a stand-up
fight; so in another minute he was lying on his
back in the dusty road, while Micky was seated
firmly aside his prostrate body.</p>

<p>‘No, I shan’t get up till you’ve apologised,’
said Micky sternly.</p>

<p>‘Ow! You’re hurting me!’ squealed Diamond
Jubilee.</p>

<p>‘Micky, do get up,’ said Emmeline. ‘You may
really hurt him.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t care if I do. Shan’t get up till he’s
apologised,’ said Micky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’m sure he’s very sorry, aren’t you, Diamond
Jubilee!’ said Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Ow!’ squealed Diamond Jubilee again.</p>

<p>‘Say after me, “I humbly apologise for being
a cad,”’ said Micky, relentlessly.</p>

<p>‘I humbly Polly’s eyes——’ gasped Diamond
Jubilee, who would have said anything required of
him at that moment. ‘Ow! Get off, can’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Say “for being a cad,”’ persisted Micky, ‘then
I’ll get off.’</p>

<p>‘Micky, <em>do</em> get off,’ pleaded Emmeline, who
was beginning to be really unhappy.</p>

<p>‘For being a cad,’ repeated Micky, firmly.</p>

<p>‘For being a cad,’ groaned Diamond Jubilee;
on which Micky sprang up with the suddenness of
a triumphant Jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>‘Shake hands,’ commanded Micky, stretching
out his paw as Diamond Jubilee rose from the
ground slowly and rather sulkily. For a moment
the street-arab seemed to hesitate. Then, sheepish
but not unfriendly, he put his very grimy little
hands into Micky’s.</p>

<p>‘That’s the sporting way to end a fight,’ explained
Micky; ‘and now Emmeline and I will
have to go home to dinner or we’ll be late, and
though Aunt Grace went to London this morning,
so that there isn’t her to think of, there’ll be a
row with Jane, which is much worse.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and we had better give you your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
dinner, as we have met you,’ said Emmeline, ‘here
it is—chocolate and monkey-nuts. They are
quite the best foods there are,’ she added hastily;
‘anyone who eats them could do perfectly well
without anything else.’</p>

<p>In spite of what she had said to Micky, a
sneaking doubt as to whether Diamond Jubilee
would approve of being the person to try the experiment,
made Emmeline keep to general terms.
There would be time enough to break to him that
chocolate and monkey-nuts were to form his sole
and lasting diet when he had already become fat
and flourishing on them.</p>

<p>He accepted the two big bags of monkey-nuts
and a small piece of milk chocolate (she had judged
it best to break off a fraction of that dainty rather
than to entrust him with the whole fortnight’s
portion), without any particular sign, either of
pleasure or disgust. Probably his half hour in the
apple-orchard had made him unusually indifferent
to what he ate.</p>

<p>‘I shan’t give you any more nuts for three
weeks,’ Emmeline told him, ‘so you must be careful
of them and not eat too many now. Can I
trust you, I wonder? I’d keep them for you only
it wouldn’t be convenient.’</p>

<p>It would not have been at all convenient. Jane
had a tiresome habit of prying into cupboards and
under beds and in all sorts of other places, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the children felt ought to have been considered
private; and as another annoying trait in her
character was a strong theory that nuts of all kinds
were bad for young people, the presence, however
unobtrusive, of two large bags of monkey-nuts in
the house, would almost certainly have led to
trouble.</p>

<p>‘Garn! I aren’t <em>that</em> fond of them monkey-nuts,’
said Diamond Jubilee mildly. He had not
the faintest suspicion, poor boy, that they were
expected to be his staple food even for that day, let
alone for an indefinite number of days to come!</p>

<p>They left him sitting under a hedge eating his
chocolate, and with a bag of monkey-nuts on either
side of him. Numbers of other nuts which had
been spilt out of Micky’s bag when he flung it
down, lay scattered about the road, but Diamond
Jubilee had made no effort to pick them up.</p>

<p>‘We forgot to tell him anywhere to meet us this
afternoon,’ remarked Micky, as he and Emmeline
were crossing the garden.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know that I want to meet him
again,’ said Emmeline wearily—‘I mean not this
afternoon,’ she added quickly, as Micky looked up
at her with round-eyed surprise.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SPARE ROOM BLANKETS</span></h2>

<p>‘I’ve thought of a splendid game for this afternoon,’
announced Micky, as the children were
finishing dinner. ‘We’ll find Diamond Jubilee, and
go to the Feudal Castle to play it, for it’s a Feudal
Castle game. Diamond Jubilee is to be an awfully
ragged, dirty pilgrim come back from the Crusades,
and Kitty and I will be quite rude to him at
first; but when the Lady of the Castle—that’s
Emmeline—sees him (you <em>will</em> come, won’t you,
Emmeline?), you’ll fling your arms round his
neck and cry, “Here is my long lost son!” for
your mother’s heart will tell you directly who he is.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Micky! I think that’s a silly game,’ said
Emmeline. ‘Diamond Jubilee really isn’t clean
enough for anyone to fling their arms around his
neck. I hope you didn’t get very close to him
in the summer-house last night?’ she added
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Oh no! He rolled up in one blanket and I
rolled up in the other,’ Micky assured her. ‘But
how fussy you are getting! I think it’s horrid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you first to adopt him and then not want us to
play with him, just because he’s rather dirty.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so silly and exaggerating, Micky. I
only didn’t want you to play at that sort of game.
I think it will be a very good plan if you take
Diamond Jubilee to the Feudal Castle and play at
something sensible there, for it may get him used
to the place before to-night.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t want to play at something sensible,’
persisted Micky. ‘I want to play at what
I said.’</p>

<p>‘I know what!’ broke in Kitty, who was always
a peacemaker. ‘Emmeline can be a stepmother;
then she won’t have to fling her arms round his
neck.’</p>

<p>‘My game was better,’ grumbled Micky, ‘but I
suppose if Emmeline won’t be the mother, she’ll
have to be the stepmother.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether I shall be able to be
anything,’ said Emmeline. ‘You see, I want to
get the blankets to the Feudal Castle this afternoon,
because I think Diamond Jubilee might
settle down there if once his blankets were there,
and of course I shall have to wait and watch for
a chance of getting them out when nobody’s
looking.’</p>

<p>‘Shall Kitty and I stop and help you?’ asked
Micky eagerly.</p>

<p>Real actual plotting, if only about blankets, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
more fun than the most splendid story-game ever
invented.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I can manage quite well by myself,’ said
Emmeline; ‘and you would find it very dull
waiting, perhaps ever so long, for a chance of
getting the blankets out of the kennel. Besides,
what I really want you to do is to keep Diamond
Jubilee safe amused and out of the garden, and if
you can get him to like the Feudal Castle it’ll be
the greatest help of all. You see, he simply <em>must</em>
sleep there alone to-night. It would be too much
of a risk for you to sleep out with him in the
summer-house again.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mean to,’ said Micky cheerfully; ‘the
summer-house is very nice for an adventure, but
not for always.’ As a matter of fact, it had been
so extremely hard and cold that it had only been
by dint of pretending that he was in prison that
Micky had enjoyed it even as an adventure.</p>

<p>To be able to play at a story-game, and to feel
at the same time that they were being ‘the
greatest help of all’ in the Diamond Jubilee
secret, was delightful to the twins; so they and
Punch trotted out of the garden to look for him
as soon as ever dinner was over; whilst Emmeline
reached down ‘The Wide Wide World’ from its
place in the bookshelf, and took it out with her to
the wooden seat on the back lawn, where she
meant to wait and watch for the coast to be clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>It was anything but clear for the moment, for
Mr. Brown was doing something to one of the
flower-beds at one end of the lawn, and Cook’s
face kept appearing at the scullery window, but
Emmeline settled herself down to wait very contentedly.
‘The Wide Wide World’ was a book
of which she never grew tired, and a quiet, peaceful
time for reading it was far more to her taste than
an afternoon with Diamond Jubilee. Try as she
would, she could not feel much craving for the
company of her adopted son.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, twenty minutes, half an hour
passed. Emmeline looked up from her story.
Cook had disappeared from the scullery window—probably
she had gone upstairs to dress for the
afternoon—but that tiresome Mr. Brown was still
attending to his flower-bed. Clearly it was not
yet the moment for making her raid, and with a
sigh, half of disappointment, half of relief, Emmeline
relapsed into her tale.</p>

<p>She had been reading for longer than she
realised, when she was startled by the crunching
of footsteps on the gravel, and turning her head,
saw Kitty and Punch coming up the path.</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you got them out yet?’ asked Kitty
in a disappointed voice as she came close up to
Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘How can I, with Mr. Brown always about?
There—I do believe he has finished at last! Oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
no, he’s only going to that other bed!’ exclaimed
Emmeline, as Mr. Brown stopped at the flower-bed
just beneath the schoolroom window. ‘What
have you come back for?’ she added. ‘It’s not
nearly tea-time yet.’</p>

<p>‘Diamond Jubilee said the monkey-nuts had
made him so thirsty he must have a drink of
water,’ explained Kitty, ‘so I thought I’d see if I
couldn’t take him some in the tooth-glass. I shall
have to wait till Mr. Brown’s gone, though,’ and
she flung herself down on the lawn by Emmeline’s
side. ‘We met Diamond Jubilee just outside the
garden,’ she continued, ‘and we’ve been having a
lovely time—at least, the last part of it was lovely.
The first part he wasn’t well (do you know,
Emmeline, I’m afraid monkey-nuts don’t agree
with him; he calls them “blooming,” and he’d
have thrown what’s left of them away, only Micky
wouldn’t let him); but after he got well again we
took him to the Feudal Castle, which he doesn’t
seem to mind when we’re there, and he told us all
sorts of exciting things about Green Ginger Land.
It sounds lovely, and like a fairy-story, doesn’t it?
But it’s really the place where Diamond Jubilee
lived with Mother Grimes and lots of other
interesting people.’</p>

<p>‘How very naughty of him to grumble at his
food!’ broke in Emmeline, who had not been
paying much attention to the last part of Kitty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
remarks. ‘I expect it was all those unripe apples
he stole that really disagreed with him, not the
monkey-nuts. He certainly is an extremely trying
boy.’</p>

<p>‘Come you here, Punch!’ Mr. Brown suddenly
shouted in a very angry voice, causing Emmeline
to jump violently, and Punch, who had been
happily employed in smelling about for imaginary
rats, to spring on to her knee, and begin wagging
his tail in a frightened, deprecating way.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter, Mr. Brown?’ called out
Kitty, bristling up directly. ‘Punch has been as
good as gold—haven’t you, darling?’ and she
kissed one of his tan cheeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was striding towards them with a
wrathful face. ‘Good as gold, have he?’ he
echoed, indignantly. ‘I’ll teach him to be as good
as gold! Trolloping over the flower-beds, and
breaking my best chrysanth’ums! A good-as-gold
beating’s what he deserves.’</p>

<p>‘No, he doesn’t! You shan’t touch him, Mr.
Brown, you cruel, wicked man!’ screamed Kitty,
while Punch raised his shrill, exasperating alarm-bark,
and Emmeline bent over him protectingly.</p>

<p>‘I shan’t have a flower left in the garden soon,’
continued the angry Mr. Brown, ‘and I reckoned
to have taken this one to the Show!’</p>

<p>‘Which one was it?’ asked Emmeline, uneasily.
‘Oh, do be quiet, Punch!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That real fine one just underneath the
scullery window,’ was the answer. ‘There’s his
footmarks all over the bed, so I know it must
have been him done it. Just you give him up
to me, and I’ll teach him a lesson. It ain’t the first
time he’ve done it, not by a long way.’</p>

<p>‘No, no—you shan’t!’ cried Emmeline, terrified
for the dog, and grasping him more tightly, while
Kitty burst into tears, and Punch himself barked
more shrilly than ever.</p>

<p>‘Why, whatever’s the matter?’ called out Cook,
suddenly appearing at the back-yard door.</p>

<p>Never had the sight of her round, good-natured
face been so welcome. Emmeline gasped an
‘Oh!’ of relief, and Kitty almost flew up the path
to meet her. ‘Cook,’ she implored, ‘You won’t
let Mr. Brown beat Punch, will you?’</p>

<p>‘What do you want to beat the poor creature
for?’ demanded Cook, who could always be depended
on to take the part of any animal in
trouble, more especially against Mr. Brown, with
whom she was never very good friends. ‘He
haven’t done no harm to nobody that I can
see.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, in course not! Breaking my show
chrysanth’um is no harm at all, is it?’ asked Mr.
Brown, which he meant for crushing sarcasm.</p>

<p>‘Well, and how do you know it was him done
it? That might have been the wind,’ retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Cook, who privately suspected Master Micky, but
would not have said so for the world.</p>

<p>‘There was his footmarks all over the bed,’
said Mr. Brown. ‘Oh, he done it sure enough,
and he deserve a good beating sure enough.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you shan’t give him one,’ said Cook,
defiantly, as she bent down and lifted Punch from
Emmeline’s knee, ‘not without you want me to
write and complain to Miss Bolton, who’d never
let you beat him for a thing like that, which you
know as well as I do. He’s going to the back-yard
now, so he won’t do no more harm to your
chrysanth’ums, and don’t you do no harm to him.’
And with that she marched off, carrying Punch,
who was barking vehemently from his safe place
of vantage in her arms.</p>

<p>‘Well, you’ll have to keep him chained up there
then,’ called Mr. Brown after them as a parting
shot, ‘for if I catch him about my garden you’ll
know what he can expect.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Brown!’ cried Kitty, dismayed at
the vista of endless captivity which seemed to be
opening before poor Punch, ‘you <em>don’t</em> mean to
say you’ll never let him run about the garden
again?’</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Brown did not seriously mean
any such thing, but it pleased him to walk away
grimly, muttering terrible threats about what he
would do to Punch if he caught him in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
again, and poor Kitty, who fully believed all he
said, burst into fresh tears. ‘Oh, what <em>shall</em> we
do?’ she sobbed. ‘Punch’ll die of grief, if he has
to be chained up for always!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but Aunt Grace would never stand that,’
said Emmeline, trying to comfort Kitty, though
she herself felt very unhappy, ‘and, of course, it’s
she who will really have to settle. It’s rubbish
for Mr. Brown to talk as if this was his garden.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help being afraid,’ she went on uneasily,
‘that it may have been Micky who broke
that chrysanthemum last night, when he jumped
down from the schoolroom window. You see it
was exactly underneath the schoolroom window—just
where he would jump. I wonder Mr.
Brown didn’t notice his footsteps, but I suppose
the rain in the night must have washed them
out, and, of course, the ones he made this morning
when he was swarming up the water-pipe would
be a little further along.’</p>

<p>‘If it was Micky it makes it all the harder on
poor darling Punch,’ said Kitty sorrowfully.</p>

<p>‘Well, we can’t be sure, you know, said Emmeline.
‘Anyhow, it’s no good crying over it now—it
isn’t as if Punch had been whipped. There’s
Mr. Brown going round to the front of the house!
You’d better run and get Diamond Jubilee’s
water, and take it out to him while you can, and
I’ll see if I can get out the blankets.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>This diverted Kitty’s attention from Punch’s
wrongs, and she ran into the house wiping her
eyes on her overall sleeve. Emmeline made her
way to the yard, but found Cook standing there
trying to comfort poor Punch, who had just been
chained up, and who looked as though he did not
at all understand or like having to go to bed so
early.</p>

<p>‘So you’ve come to talk to the poor animal,’
remarked Cook. ‘I reckon it’s best to chain him
up for a bit, or he’d be running out into the
garden and getting into Mr. Brown’s way, but
it do seem hard.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think he would really beat him?’
asked Emmeline, trying to conceal the fact that
she was rather dismayed at finding anybody
there.</p>

<p>‘Well, I can’t say,’ was the answer; ‘he haven’t
no love for dumb creatures, that’s certain, though
he isn’t what you could call a cruel man. Anyway,
it won’t do no harm to keep Punch out of his way
for a little.’</p>

<p>Emmeline talked to Cook and Punch for a
minute or two longer, and then went back into
the garden. Unfortunately Mr. Brown, too, had
returned by this time, so it was plainly hopeless to
think of taking out the blankets yet, even when
Cook left the yard. Meanwhile Punch, left alone
in the dull back-yard, was feeling himself a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
much injured dog. He proclaimed the fact to the
world by a series of yelping barks, but he was an
animal of a philosophic turn of mind, so it
presently struck him that, since he was chained up
at this untimely hour, he might as well retire into
his kennel and go to sleep comfortably in the snug
dark corner at the very back.</p>

<p>Ah! That special corner was already occupied
by something woolly and unfamiliar—something
which crowded Punch uncomfortably,
something which was, in fact, nothing more nor
less than one of the spare room blankets! It
had fallen a little from the tumbled heap in
which Micky had pushed it, so that it now
took up a good deal more room than it had done
in the morning.</p>

<p>If Punch had been in a sleepier or lazier mood
he might have managed to make it into a cosy
nest for himself. As it was, he chose to pretend
that it was a giant white rat, and to treat it accordingly.
It was really an ideal game for a bored
fox-terrier—from the bored fox-terrier’s own point
of view, that is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jane’s point of view was a different
one, and when she presently came into the
back-yard to hang up some odds and ends that
she had been washing, and found Punch worrying
a great heap of defenceless blanket which was
protruding from his kennel, her horror and indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
knew no bounds. She could hardly believe
her own eyes indeed, till she had come close up to
the kennel and bent down to examine Punch’s
plaything. Yes, it really <em>was</em> a blanket!</p>

<p>‘It’s them children again!’ she cried wrathfully.
‘Why, bless me’—with a voice growing
shriller and shriller—‘bless me, if it isn’t one of
them <em>new</em> blankets we got special for the spare
room!’</p>

<p>Cook and Alice came running out into the yard
to see what was the matter, and Punch, who had
left off worrying the blanket, began wagging his
tail nervously. He was not used to holding such
a levée, and felt more embarrassed than gratified
at all the attention which was being paid him.</p>

<p>‘Well, I never!’ exclaimed Cook, as Jane gave
such a violent tug to that part of the blanket
which was lying outside the kennel that the rest
of it also emerged. ‘However on earth did it
get there?’</p>

<p>‘It’s them wicked children, of course,’ said Jane,
angrily. ‘And if I don’t make them sorry for it,
my name isn’t Jane Martin!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, we can trust you for that!’ remarked
Cook. ‘But I must say this do beat everything.
Cheer up, Punch, old boy! Nobody’s going to
hurt you.’ She was just bending down to pat
him reassuringly, when she uttered a sudden exclamation:
‘Why, I do believe there’s another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of them! There! Come you out, Punch. Yes,
there really is.’</p>

<p>Jane paused in the vicious shaking she was
giving the first blanket, and stared at Cook in a
startled way. ‘Another what?’ she demanded.
‘You don’t mean to say another <em>dog</em>?’ Jane
hated dogs.</p>

<p>Cook laughed with unnecessary heartiness.
‘No, another blanket,’ she exclaimed between her
peals of mirth. ‘Here, get away, Punch, and let
me look.’ She undid the animal’s chain, and then,
as he bounded about in great delight, she poked
first a head and then a long arm into the kennel,
whence she presently came out red, panting, and
triumphantly holding up a second blanket!</p>

<p>‘Well!’ gasped Jane, and stopped short, unable
for the moment to find words strong enough to
express her feelings.</p>

<p>Then Alice gave a nervous giggle, and Jane
turned round on her sharply.</p>

<p>‘What business have you here, miss, laughing
at your betters?’ she demanded angrily. ‘I’ll
teach you——’</p>

<p>What she meant to teach Alice never appeared,
for just at that moment the yard-door was flung
violently open, and in rushed Micky, hot, breathless,
and dirty, with Kitty following close on his
heels.</p>

<p>‘It was I who broke the chrysanthemum, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Punch,’ panted Micky. ‘Unchain him—oh, I see
he is unchained! That’s all right.’</p>

<p>‘All right, is it, Master Micky?’ cried Jane,
shrilly. ‘This’—and she held up her blanket—‘<em>this</em>
isn’t what I call all right, nor <em>that</em> either!’
and she pointed to the other blanket.</p>

<p>Kitty looked thoroughly scared, and for a
fraction of a second even Micky seemed rather
taken aback, but he recovered himself instantly.</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry you don’t like the blankets,’ he
remarked politely. ‘Aunt Grace will be disappointed,
too, for I’m sure she meant to get nice
ones for the spare room.’</p>

<p>‘Well, of all the impudent children!’ ejaculated
the outraged Jane.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ cried Emmeline, who came hurrying in to see what
was going on, ‘what’s the mat——’
She broke off suddenly, and turned quite pale as
she caught sight of the blankets. Everything
would be found out now!</p>

<p>‘The matter is, Miss Emmeline,’ said Jane,
‘that the new spare room blankets have just been
found in a disgusting, dirty dog-kennel.’ (‘Well,
I gave it a wash-out last week, so it can’t
be so bad as all that,’ murmured Cook in a low
voice.) ‘Put there, I’m very much afraid, by
Master Micky,’ went on Jane, disregarding the
interruption, and fixing Micky with an awful
glare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I put them there myself this morning,’
said Micky.</p>

<p>‘You did, did you?’ cried Jane, dropping her
tragic tone and relapsing into shrillness. ‘And
may I make so bold as to ask what you put them
there for?’</p>

<p>Emmeline was trembling so much that she had
to steady herself against the door-post. What
<em>would</em> Micky say?</p>

<p>‘Oh, I thought it would be a nice safe place
to keep them in,’ answered Micky, with great
serenity.</p>

<p>This was altogether too much for Jane.</p>

<p>‘You’re the naughtiest, most mis-<em>chiev</em>-ous
child that ever I saw!’ she exclaimed, taking him
by the shoulders and shaking him till his teeth
chattered. ‘It’s downright pure mischiefulness—that’s
what it is, and I’ll make you sorry for it,
that I will! You’ll come off to bed this very
moment.’</p>

<p>Kitty burst into a howl of sympathy. To be
sent to bed was the most terrible punishment
known to the little Boltons.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jane, give him just <em>one</em> more trial,’ she
wailed. ‘He’ll never do it again—w-will you,
Micky?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind, Kitty,’ said Micky, assuming an
air of saintly resignation which maddened Jane.
‘I’ll try to bear it, and she’ll be sorry one day.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Bear it or not, you’ll come to bed <em>this instant</em>!’
said Jane, seizing hold of his sailor-collar and
marching him off.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the door into the kitchen,
she paused to say to Alice: ‘You’d better hang
them blankets upon the line. I’ll not have them
in the house again till they have been well washed,
after being stuffed up with that dirty dog.’</p>

<p>‘There’s many a Christian been a longer time
without a bath than Punch,’ remarked Cook;
whereupon Micky turned his head and gave
Emmeline as deliberate a wink as Jane allowed
him time for. Luckily neither Jane nor Cook
seemed to notice the wink, or if they did, they
merely took it for one more sign of the outrageous
‘mischiefulness,’ which was supposed to account for
the blankets being found in the kennel at all.</p>

<p>Emmeline began to breathe freely again when
once Jane and Micky had disappeared into the
house. It had been a dreadful five minutes, but
they seemed to have come out of the scrape better
than could have been expected.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">TROUBLES</span></h2>

<p>In spite of Emmeline’s relief that the blanket affair
had passed off without their secret being discovered,
the rest of the afternoon was thoroughly spoilt for
both her and Kitty.</p>

<p>Kitty left off crying presently and stole upstairs
to take the now empty tooth-glass out of its
hiding-place in her dress-pocket underneath her
overall; after which she went on to Micky’s room
in the hope of being able to bear him company.
Jane had locked the door however, and carried off
the key, so that Kitty had to creep downstairs
again, feeling very much grieved and disappointed.</p>

<p>‘It does seem hard poor Micky should have all
the punishment when we were just as much in it
really,’ Kitty remarked sadly to Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Well, but we weren’t quite,’ said Emmeline,
‘putting the blankets in the kennel was quite his
own idea, you know.’ But, in spite of this, she was
too fair-minded a child not to feel uncomfortable
at the injustice as well as very sorry for poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Micky. But what troubled her most was the fact
that the blankets would no longer be available.
Diamond Jubilee would be so cold without them,
and, besides, how should she persuade him to
sleep at the Feudal Castle now that they could
not be held out as an inducement? She had
been worrying over the problem for a good while
when it suddenly struck her that she had read
somewhere that newspapers made almost as warm
a bed-covering as blankets. How would it be to
take some out to the Feudal Castle? She knew
just where the old <em>Standards</em> were kept.</p>

<p>Unhappily it was nearly tea-time when Emmeline
had this brilliant inspiration, and just as she
was getting up to carry it into effect, Jane came
across the lawn to where the two girls were sitting
with the glum announcement that it was time to
come in and get tidy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Stone walls do not a prison make,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nor iron bars a cage!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">sang Micky’s voice, very loud and very much out
of tune.</p>

<p>They all looked up, startled, and saw him leaning
out of his window, clad in his flannel pyjamas,
and grinning defiantly.</p>

<p>‘Master Micky, if you don’t get back to bed
<em>this instant</em>, you shan’t have any tea at all, not
even dry bread,’ said Jane, and Micky beat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hasty retreat. Troubles never took away his
appetite, and he knew from past experience that
Jane’s threats were not empty ones.</p>

<p>It was soon Kitty’s turn to get into trouble.
Never was there such a day of scrapes.</p>

<p>They were in the middle of tea when Jane
stalked grimly in, carrying an article, the sight of
which nearly made Emmeline drop her cup with
fright. It was the hot-water can with Kitty’s
sash attached to its spout and handle. All the
agitations of the day had driven the thought of it
out of their heads, and it had lain forgotten under
its laurel-bush until five minutes ago, when Mr.
Brown had unfortunately caught a glimpse of the
blue sash and dragged it to light.</p>

<p>‘What’s the meaning of this, Miss Kitty?’
demanded Jane, in a voice of awful calm.</p>

<p>Kitty had nothing like Micky’s coolness. She
turned crimson, hung her head, and muttered
something about a lift, which made Emmeline feel
terribly alarmed as to what she might be going to
let out.</p>

<p>‘A lift!’ sniffed Jane, pouncing on the poor
word, ‘and what have you been <em>lifting</em> with your
best party sash, I’d like to know? Leaving it out
in the rain, too, till the colour’s all run, and it’s
only fit for the rag-bag!’</p>

<p>‘It was—some things I wanted to let down to
Micky in the garden,’ stammered Kitty, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as though she very much hoped the floor would
open and swallow her up.</p>

<p>‘Umph!’ grunted Jane. ‘Toys, I suppose,
that he was too lazy to go up and fetch for himself,
so he made you save him the trouble, same
as he did the other day. <em>I</em> know his ways!’ (As
a matter of fact, Micky was anything but lazy;
and, though it was quite true that Jane had caught
Kitty fagging for him the other day, that was
only because he had happened to be a cruel
slave-owner for the afternoon.) ‘That was it,
wasn’t it?’</p>

<p>Kitty blushed a yet deeper crimson, and hung
her head a little lower.</p>

<p>‘I thought so!’ said Jane. ‘Well, <em>you</em> can come
to bed, too, and then perhaps you’ll know better
another time. Come along,’ and, seizing Kitty’s
hand, she marched off with her, muttering something
about never having known such goings on
in all her born days.</p>

<p>Emmeline could hear Kitty bursting into a howl
as she was led upstairs, and she herself felt so
unhappy that she could hardly find it in her heart
even to be relieved that Jane had not been more
pressing in her questions. It was not only that
she was sorry for Kitty, but it seemed so mean to
let the twins be punished without coming forward
to take her share of the blame; and yet, of course,
it would be impossible to do so without betraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the secret and ruining everything. ‘And that I
mustn’t do, for Diamond Jubilee’s sake,’ she told
herself; ‘but, oh dear, I never guessed, when I
first started the idea of adopting him, that it would
lead to all this worry!’</p>

<p>She was not long in finishing her now solitary
meal, for a restless desire had seized her to be up
and doing. She was just going to the cupboard
where the old <em>Standards</em> were kept, when a
sudden thought made her pause. Aunt Grace
had once told the children that they were on their
honour to begin their lessons for the next day as
soon as tea was over, and that she trusted them
to do so, whether or not she was there to see.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I must wait, then,’ she said to herself,
with an impatient sigh, as she turned away
and went slowly up to the schoolroom. It was
very tiresome, when she did so want to go and
settle Diamond Jubilee in for the night at the
Feudal Castle.</p>

<p>Her lessons took her longer than usual that
evening, for she found it very hard to give her
full attention to them; but she had almost finished
when she was startled by Jane’s coming in with
the supper-tray.</p>

<p>‘Why, it can’t be eight o’clock yet!’ she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘No, Miss Emmeline, it’s only just past seven;
but Cook and I are going to church, and choir-practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
afterwards, and we shan’t be in till past
nine, so I thought I’d better bring you your supper
now.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I see,’ said Emmeline, in the voice in
which people close a subject, but rather to her
annoyance, Jane still lingered.</p>

<p>‘Miss Emmeline,’ she began, with evident
hesitation, ‘there’s something I think it right
to warn you about.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ asked Emmeline nervously. She
felt a sudden dread that the warning might have
something to do with Diamond Jubilee.</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s about Alice,’ said Jane. (Emmeline
breathed freely again.) ‘I hardly like to speak of
it, but I feel it’s my duty. You know Tuesday’s
the day she always turns out your room. Well,
when I went in there to put Miss Kitty to bed,
I noticed the box which you keep the money
in for the Poor Children’s Home had fallen off
your chest of drawers and was lying on the
floor. Well, I picked it up’—she paused, and
went on impressively—‘and I found it was quite
empty!’</p>

<p>‘Was it?’ said Emmeline, uneasily. ‘But I
don’t see what Alice has to do with it.’</p>

<p>‘And you wouldn’t see,’ said Jane, in the tone
habitual to grieved charity, ‘not unless you knew
Alice’s history. She was turned away from her
first place for taking some money that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
left loose in a drawer, and Miss Bolton only took
her to give her a chance of making a fresh start.
She’s been here six weeks now, and nothing’s
been missed, so we did hope she was going to do
better, but I’m afraid now she is falling back into
her old ways, and that we shall have to part with
her. But don’t you say anything about this to
anybody, please, Miss Emmeline. I only told you
as a warning to be careful what you leave about,
and because I knew you’d wonder about the box
being empty.’</p>

<p>Never in her life had Emmeline felt so miserably
uncomfortable. She was a naturally honourable
child, and at the bottom of her heart she
knew that she ought to confess to having taken
the money herself, and not let Alice rest under
unjust suspicion a moment longer. But then
Jane would ask horrid prying questions and
everything would come out. After all, she told
herself, she was really not bound to confide in
Jane; it was no business of Jane’s what she
did with her money.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think it’s at all charitable of you to
make out that poor Alice is a thief, when you
can’t possibly know anything about it!’ she exclaimed
hotly—she did feel very angry with
Jane for having put her into such a horrid
position—‘and, anyhow, you can’t send her away,
only Aunt Grace can do that, and I’m sure she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
won’t without a much better reason for thinking
Alice took the money.’</p>

<p>Jane was greatly offended and astonished.</p>

<p>‘I hope I know my place, Miss Emmeline,’
she remarked huffily, ‘I should never think of
giving Alice notice myself, but I’ve no doubt that
Miss Bolton will when I’ve told her my suspicions,
which I shall feel it my bounden duty to do.’</p>

<p>‘But Jane,’ said Emmeline, almost crying, ‘do
try to have a little charity. You know how much
the Bible says about charity!’</p>

<p>‘Miss Emmeline,’ said Jane, in her most dignified
manner, ‘I don’t think I need any little girl
to teach me about the Bible, which I’ve been
through seven times already, and have got as
far through the eighth time as the seventh of
Numbers; but I know my duty, and my duty is
to see that there are only honest servants in this
house; and I think I’m a better judge of who are
honest than any little girl!’ And with this parting
shot she stalked away, slamming the door behind
her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?’ said
Emmeline, half aloud, as she wandered restlessly
about the room. ‘I never was in such a dreadful
bother. Oh, what <em>can</em> I do?’</p>

<p>‘Tell them you’ve taken the money yourself,’
whispered her conscience: ‘that’s the only honest
thing to do.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But that would mean betraying Diamond
Jubilee, and Aunt Grace would be sure to send
him back to that wicked old Mother Grimes,’ said
Emmeline, arguing with her conscience, as people
do when they cannot make up their minds to the
course of action which they know to be right.
‘Diamond Jubilee would be ruined body and soul.
Perhaps some day he would be even hanged!
No, I <em>must</em> think of some other way.’</p>

<p>But wander about as she might she could think
of no other plan. She did indeed picture herself
pleading eloquently with Aunt Grace not to send
Alice away, but her conscience told her that even
if she succeeded, she would still be wronging the
girl by allowing her to remain under suspicion.
Besides, Aunt Grace might not listen to her any
more than Jane had done.</p>

<p>‘Well, anyhow, Jane can’t do anything till Aunt
Grace comes home,’ she said to herself at last,
‘and there’ll be plenty of time for settling what to
do before then, so I won’t think about it any
more just now. It’s quite time to be seeing
about Diamond Jubilee’s newspapers.’</p>

<p>The thought struck Emmeline that she might
take Diamond Jubilee her own supper at the
same time that she carried the newspapers to
him. It would be an unusually good opportunity
to do so now that Jane and Cook were both out;
and, though she had meant him to live on nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and chocolate from that day forward, it seemed
kinder to break him in more gradually. So
thought Emmeline, with some vague instinct of
trying to make up for any wrong she might be
doing Alice, by being specially nice and unselfish
to Diamond Jubilee.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she was standing on the
outskirts of the wood with her glass of milk in
one hand and her biscuit and bundle of newspapers
in the other. It had been rather difficult
to climb the railings without spilling the milk,
and she could not help hoping she should not
have to carry it very far before she came across
Diamond Jubilee. She had half-expected to meet
him already, lurking somewhere about the lane,
or even in the garden itself; indeed, she had
peeped into the summer-house just to make sure
he was not there, but, so far there had been no
sign of him. Surely she would find him soon.</p>

<p>Walking slowly and cautiously for fear of spilling
her milk, she made her way on towards the
Feudal Castle. At every few yards she paused,
and looked round and behind her. Just at first
she did this in the hope of seeing Diamond Jubilee,
but as the trees grew thicker her glances over her
shoulder became more and more uneasy and
hurried. Now that she was alone there in the
eerie moonlight, the familiar wood was a frightening,
uncanny place, full of weird shadows and dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
half-seen shapes—shapes which turned into trees
when she stared at them hard, but which seemed
to change slyly back into something quite different
as soon as she looked away to see what was
making that odd creaking noise on her other side.
Once, when an owl gave a loud, unearthly hoot, it
was as much as Emmeline could do not to fling
down what she was carrying and run home in mad
panic, but she was a child who never could bear
to be beaten, so she set her teeth and walked
steadily on.</p>

<p>After walking for a quarter of an hour, which
seemed infinitely longer than any other fifteen
minutes in the whole course of her life, she reached
the Feudal Castle. It looked so horribly dark
and lonely and deserted as it loomed up among
those ghostly moonlit trees, that it was some
moments before Emmeline could summon up
courage to open the worm-eaten door and step
into the darkness inside, but at last she forced herself
to do so.</p>

<p>She started, and trembled all over at the echo
of her own footsteps on the bare floor.</p>

<p>‘Are you there, Diamond Jubilee?’ she asked,
in a voice which sounded to herself so unnatural
that it frightened her more than ever.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but to her excited nerves
the whole place seemed full of half-heard whisperings
and mutterings. The terror of it was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
much for her, and, dropping her newspapers and
the biscuit on to the floor, she fled out of the
cottage and ran wildly home.</p>

<p>Once she tripped over a tree-root and fell,
spilling all her milk, which had not already been
splashed out—she had not dared to leave it at the
Feudal Castle for fear of the glass being missed—but
she scrambled up again without even waiting
to find out whether she was hurt or the tumbler
broken.</p>

<p>She was back at last in the safe hall of Fir-tree
Cottage, blinking her eyes in the bright lamplight,
and reflecting ruefully that, after all, her expedition
had been of very little use, since she had not been
able to tell Diamond Jubilee of the biscuit and
newspapers which were awaiting him at the
Feudal Castle if only he would go and sleep there,
or to explain the purpose for which the newspapers
were intended.</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s no use troubling about him any more
to-night,’ she said to herself wearily as she went
upstairs. ‘I’ve done all I can, and, anyhow, he
doesn’t seem to be sleeping in the garden, which
is one good thing. It’s very odd where he can
be, though.’</p>

<p>She put the glass back on its tray—fortunately,
it had not been broken—and went to her own
room. It was not quite bedtime yet, but she was
still feeling too creepy to want to sit up alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The first thing that met her ear when she opened
the door was the sound of Kitty crying, not
howling, as she often did, but just crying in a low,
unhappy way.</p>

<p>‘Why, Kitty!’ exclaimed Emmeline, impatiently—it
was a relief to be impatient with somebody
just then—’ I thought you’d have been asleep long
ago. You <em>are</em> a baby to be still crying because
you were sent to bed early! You’d have been in
bed by now, anyhow.’</p>

<p>‘It’s n-not that,’ sobbed Kitty.</p>

<p>‘What is it, then?’ demanded Emmeline, sharply.</p>

<p>‘Because—I don’t think I was <em>true</em> this afternoon,’
said Kitty, tearfully. ‘Jane asked if the
lift was for Micky’s toys, and I lowered my head,
and I think she thought I was nodding, though I
didn’t mean her to, but I think she thought I
meant it was. And Aunt Grace says it’s almost
as bad as to let people think what’s not true as to
tell a story. Oh, Emmeline, what shall I do?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t be so silly, Kitty!’ said Emmeline,
crossly. ‘Nobody would get on at all if they
were so particular as all that—at least I don’t
mean that exactly,’ as Kitty opened her eyes,
‘but you really mustn’t worry about fancies. It
wasn’t your fault if Jane chose to take a wrong
idea into her head.’</p>

<p>‘Then you’re <em>quite sure</em> I wasn’t untruthful?’
asked Kitty, trying hard to be reassured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ said Emmeline; ‘and now go to
sleep, and don’t talk to me any more.’</p>

<p>Kitty obeyed for about five minutes, but when
Emmeline rose from her knees again, after saying
her prayers far more hurriedly than usual, the
effort of silence became too great a strain for
the little sister.</p>

<p>‘Do you think adopting somebody always leads
to such a lot of horridness?’ she asked abruptly.
‘I mean the wrong one being punished for what
someone else did, and people not being sure that
they haven’t as good as told stories, and being
sent to bed ever so early, and not having any
supper when they’re most frightfully hungry?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what you are talking about,’ said
Emmeline, frightened and angry. ‘Who’s being
punished for what someone else did?’</p>

<p>‘Why, Punch was, of course!’ said Kitty, a
little taken aback at Emmeline’s manner; ‘though
Cook did give him an extra big supper afterwards
to make up, she told me just now, but somehow I
don’t think even an extra big supper quite makes
up for being accused of what you haven’t done.
Do you think it does, Emmeline?’</p>

<p>Emmeline made no answer, and Kitty felt
snubbed and subsided into silence. Presently afterwards
Emmeline jumped into bed and blew out
the candle. The room had been dark for some
little time, and Kitty was becoming sleepy when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she was startled wide-awake again by a strange
sound in the part of the room where Emmeline
was lying. She sat up, leaning on her elbows, and
listened. Yes, there it was again! There could
be no mistake about it. Emmeline was crying!</p>

<p>A moment later Kitty had scrambled on to
Emmeline’s counterpane, and was cuddling her in
the most motherly way imaginable.</p>

<p>‘What is it, my poor darling?’ she was asking,
in the tender voice that she usually kept for
Punch. She and Micky, though very devoted,
were not demonstrative to each other.</p>

<p>Just at first Emmeline went on sobbing without
making any answer, in a way which was alarmingly
strange to Kitty; and even when the answer did
come, it puzzled Kitty more than it enlightened
her. ‘Oh, I wish I was a dear, good, little thing
like you!’ whispered Emmeline, catching hold
of her.</p>

<p>‘Why, Emmeline!’ cried Kitty, with unfeigned
astonishment. ‘You are always ever so much
gooder than me and Micky—quite annoyingly
good sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m not,’ cried Emmeline. ‘I’m horrid!’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you’re not horrid,’ said Kitty loyally.
‘You’re very nice and kind. Why, Micky and I
would never have even thought of taking Diamond
Jubilee as a brand from the burning if it hadn’t
been for you!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps this reflection was less comforting than
Kitty imagined; but Emmeline relapsed into
silence after that—silence which lasted so long
that Kitty fancied she had fallen asleep, and crept
back to her own bed.</p>

<p>But it was a long time before Emmeline really
fell asleep that night.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">GONE!</span></h2>

<p>‘Where’s Micky?’ inquired Kitty the next morning
when Jane came into the dining-room with
the teapot and the grim announcement that breakfast
was quite ready, and the young ladies had
better come to table.</p>

<p>‘He’s a very naughty, dirty boy,’ said Jane, as
though that was a sufficient answer to Kitty’s
question.</p>

<p>‘He hasn’t had much time to be naughty yet,
poor Micky!’ said Kitty, in an aggrieved voice.</p>

<p>The twins always expected the offences of
yesterday to be buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>Jane did not see fit to notice the remark, and,
when the door had closed behind her, Kitty
returned to her wonder.</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose Micky’s been playing that his
soap-dish is a ship in a storm as he did the other
day, and that Jane won’t let him come down to
breakfast?’</p>

<p>The guess was a fairly likely one, for the game
to which Kitty alluded involved such a free dispersal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of bath-water all over the floor that Jane
was quite likely to consider it both naughty and
dirty though, as Micky had pointed out, you
could not well play with cleaner things than soap
and water.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, and don’t care,’ said Emmeline,
shortly.</p>

<p>She had wakened up that morning in a very
bad temper.</p>

<p>‘It’s rather horrid of you, then,’ said Kitty,
reproachfully; ‘specially as there are eggs, and
Micky didn’t have much tea last night or any
supper, I don’t suppose. I think I’ll go up and
see what’s happening to him. I don’t care if Jane
does catch me.’</p>

<p>Emmeline did not trouble to make any objection,
and Kitty departed on her quest. A moment
later she returned with the news that it was all
right; Micky was not in his room.</p>

<p>‘I expect he’s just out climbing trees somewhere,
and will be in to breakfast directly,’ she
surmised cheerfully, as she attacked her eggshell
with energy.</p>

<p>But the minutes passed on, and no Micky
appeared. By the time they had almost got
through even the bread-and-jam stage of breakfast
Emmeline was becoming rather anxious. It
was so unlike Micky to show such indifference to
his meals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Isn’t he in yet?’ asked Jane, coming into the
dining-room abruptly, and looking more worried
than stern this time.</p>

<p>‘No, I suppose he must be in the wood somewhere,
too far off to hear the bell,’ said Emmeline,
more frightened by Jane’s manner than she had
been before.</p>

<p>‘It’s the strangest thing where he can be,’ said
Jane. ‘He was sleeping as peaceful as could be
when I unlocked the door before starting to church
yesterday evening, but when I went to call him
this morning the bed was empty, and he was
nowhere to be seen. He must have dressed and
gone out without washing or anything, for the jug
was still standing in the basin as I put it back last
night. Not that there’s anything strange in that,
for it’s just like his ways, but it is odd he isn’t
in yet.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll just go out and see if I can find him,’ said
Emmeline, rising from the table as she hastily
swallowed a last mouthful of bread and jam.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been and looked all round the garden.’
said Jane; ‘and Alice went some little way into
the wood, but she couldn’t see him anywhere. I
can’t think what can have come to him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I expect he’ll turn up soon,’ said Emmeline,
trying hard to feel confident.</p>

<p>‘We’ll hope so, Miss Emmeline,’ said Jane,
gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty’s round honest face was looking rather
scared.</p>

<p>‘Do you think anything can have happened to
Micky?’ she asked anxiously, as Jane went out of
the room.</p>

<p>‘Oh no. I expect he’s in the wood somewhere
with Diamond Jubilee, and has just lost count of
time,’ said Emmeline, with determined cheerfulness.
‘Very likely we shall find them both in the
Feudal Castle.’</p>

<p>Accordingly they put on their hats and, going
out into the wood, made their way towards the
Feudal Castle. As they walked they kept shouting
‘Micky!’ ‘Cooee!’ at the tops of their voices,
but there was never the faintest response.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t suppose they can hear us if
they’re right inside the Feudal Castle,’ said
Emmeline, hoarse, but still reassuring.</p>

<p>But when they reached the Feudal Castle
neither Micky nor Diamond Jubilee was there;
what was more, the uneaten biscuit, which was
still lying among the newspapers just as Emmeline
had dropped it, seemed to show that
they never had been there since yesterday
evening.</p>

<p>Even Emmeline’s courage gave way at that
point.</p>

<p>‘Wherever <em>can</em> he be?’ she exclaimed, almost
tearfully. She might have said ‘they,’ but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
odd how very little Diamond Jubilee seemed to
matter just then.</p>

<p>‘I do believe <em>that</em> Diamond Jubilee’s at the
bottom of it somehow,’ remarked Kitty, who was
beginning to feel very miserable indeed.</p>

<p>Emmeline had all along had an uneasy suspicion
that he might be, but she did not like to hear her
own secret fear put into words by Kitty.</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose it’s a bit more poor Diamond
Jubilee’s fault than Micky’s,’ she snapped. ‘Most
likely they’re both climbing trees somewhere a
little farther on in the wood, and if they are it will
have been Micky’s idea, not Diamond Jubilee’s.
Come along.’</p>

<p>They left the Feudal Castle and continued their
walk towards the Chudstone edge of the wood.</p>

<p>‘We shall be late for Miss Miller,’ remarked
Emmeline; ‘but, really, we can’t trouble about
lessons at such a crisis.’</p>

<p>That word ‘crisis’ afforded some little comfort
to Emmeline for a moment; Aunt Grace had
used it yesterday, and it sounded delightfully
grown-up.</p>

<p>They went right to the end of the wood,
cooeeying all the way, but with no more success
than before, after which there was clearly nothing
to be done but to turn and go back home again.
They did so, feeling too tired and too much out of
heart even to cooee this time, or to make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
fresh conjectures as to what could have become
of Micky. That silent walk home seemed to
drag on a weary while, but it was over at last.
No sooner had they opened the garden-door than
they caught sight of Miss Miller, Jane, Cook, and
Alice, all standing in a row on the gravel path
near the back-yard door, and all evidently keeping
an anxious look-out for the children’s return.
Perhaps the fact that the entire work of the household
should be at a standstill while it waited for
tidings brought home to Emmeline more than
anything else how very serious the state of affairs
was.</p>

<p>‘Well, haven’t you found him?’ called out
Cook, as the two girls approached.</p>

<p>‘Of course they haven’t! Do you think
they’ve got him hidden in their pockets?’
snapped Jane. Worry of mind was making her
more short-tempered even than usual.</p>

<p>‘No, we haven’t found him, and we’ve been
right to the Chudstone end of the wood to look
for him,’ said Emmeline, in a voice of utter
discouragement, while big tears rolled down
Kitty’s cheeks.</p>

<p>‘Don’t cry, Kitty dear,’ said Miss Miller,
soothingly; ‘Micky can’t be very far off’; but, in
spite of her cheering words, the governess’s face
was very anxious. She herself had just returned
from looking for Micky in the village, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
nothing had been heard or seen of him. ‘I
wonder if we ought to wire to Miss Bolton,’ she
added, in a lower voice.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see that there’s any call for that,’
said Jane, grumpily. ‘She’d only be worried to
death between thinking she ought to come back
here and not liking to leave Miss King. Besides,
as likely as not Master Micky’s only hiding
somewhere near about for fun, for a more mischieful
boy I never did see.’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps it would be best not to telegraph
just yet, at all events,’ said Miss Miller,
rather stiffly—she thought Jane apt to presume
on her privileges as an old servant—‘but one step
I’m sure we ought to take is to give notice at
Chudstone Police-Station that the child’s missing.
Then they’ll telephone on to the other police-stations
in the neighbourhood. I think that
will be far more effective than going out to look
for him, for as we don’t know in the least which
way to go, we might be wandering about the
whole day without getting any nearer finding
him. I’ll just bicycle over to Chudstone now.
While I’m gone you can be reading to Kitty the
next story in the Greek history,’ she added to
Emmeline, with an idea of diverting their
attention.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Miller,’ broke in Kitty, with a fresh
outbreak of tears, ‘people just <em>can’t</em> do Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
history when their twins are lost! Do let us go
and look for him in the wood just once more!’</p>

<p>Miss Miller did not think the search likely to be
any more successful than before, but she had not
the heart to refuse. ‘Well, you may go then,’
she said, kindly, ‘but don’t go outside the wood,
and come back as soon as it’s eleven o’clock by
Emmeline’s watch, even if you haven’t found him.’</p>

<p>Five minutes later Miss Miller had set out on
her bicycle for Chudstone, and the two girls and
Punch had begun another expedition through the
woods. It had been a brilliant idea of Kitty’s to
include Punch in the party. ‘In all the stories of
children getting lost there’s always a gallant
Newfoundland who rescues them,’ she had remarked.
To be sure Punch was about as much
like a gallant Newfoundland as the Feudal Castle
was like a castle, but that was a detail.</p>

<p>‘I expect Punch’ll scent Micky out long before
the police could find him,’ said Kitty, almost
cheering up again as she and Emmeline climbed
the railings dividing the wood from the road.
‘What shall we do supposing he tracks him out of
the wood?’ she went on as Emmeline kept
silence, feeling too miserable to answer. ‘For
we promised Miss Miller not to go outside.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Emmeline impatiently.
‘There’ll be time enough to think of
that when he does track him out.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>There certainly was time enough. Punch’s behaviour
in the wood was most disappointing. It
was in vain that they urged him to ‘go find
Micky, like a good dog.’ He only stood stock
still, wagging his tail apologetically, and staring
up at them with a worried expression in his
wistful brown eyes. It was so impossible to
make him realise that for the first time in his life
he was expected to take the lead in a walk, that
at last, in despair, they had to give up trying to
do. After that Punch trotted along happily a
few feet behind them, except once when he raised
their hopes cruelly by sniffing the ground violently
and then rushing away among the bushes, only to
come back a minute or two later with the rather
crestfallen look he always had after wild and
unsuccessful pursuits. It was only too plain
that it had been a hunting expedition, not a
rescue one.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Punch, you aren’t nearly so much good
as a story dog!’ complained poor Kitty, ‘how can
you think about hunting rabbits when Uncle
Micky’s lost?’</p>

<p>It was nearer twelve than eleven o’clock when
the two girls came home again, after a weary and
futile search, but Miss Miller did not say a word
of reproach to them. She herself had not been
waiting for them long, for, though her ride to
Chudstone and back had only taken about half-an-hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
she had since been out again looking for
Micky here, there and everywhere. One or other
of the servants too, had been constantly going off
to some place where it had suddenly struck
them that the boy might possibly be, but, so far,
everybody’s searching had been equally in vain.
Micky might have disappeared from off the face
of the earth for all the trace of him that they
could find.</p>

<p>‘Come up to the schoolroom and rest,’ said Miss
Miller, kindly. ‘I won’t bother you with any real
lessons to-day, but I’ll read some “Marmion”
aloud to you.’</p>

<p>They were just reading ‘Marmion’ for their
literature. As a rule they were thrilled by it, but
this morning neither Emmeline nor Kitty took in
much of what they read. Sitting still only made
them realise their trouble the more vividly, and
Kitty was on the verge of breaking into a howl
when Jane came in to ask Miss Miller if she might
speak to her alone for a moment. She made
the request with such an air of mystery that
Emmeline’s heart began to thump wildly.</p>

<p>‘Jane, tell me!’ she gasped. ‘Micky—has anything
happened?’</p>

<p>‘I know no more of Master Micky than you
do,’ said Jane. ‘I only wish I did,’ she added,
in a gentler voice than the children had ever yet
heard her use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I think I ought to tell you, Miss Miller,’ began
Jane, after Miss Miller had followed her from the
room, ‘Mrs. Tom Wright was round just now,
and told us something which upset me very much.
It seems her husband saw Master Micky playing
in the wood yesterday afternoon with a little tramp
boy.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me! That doesn’t seem suitable,’ remarked
Miss Miller, trying hard to be as much
shocked and surprised as Jane evidently expected.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ continued Jane solemnly, ‘I shouldn’t
be a bit surprised if that little tramp boy isn’t at
the bottom of it all.’</p>

<p>‘Of Micky’s disappearing, do you mean?’ asked
Miss Miller, really surprised and alarmed this
time. ‘Why, what makes you think that?’</p>

<p>‘Because yesterday afternoon wasn’t the only
time this last day or two that boy’s been seen
haunting about the place,’ said Jane. ‘I saw him
myself on Monday night—at least, a boy who
came round to the side-door begging answered
very much to the description of the one Tom
Wright saw in the wood. I thought at the time
that I’d never seen such a filthy little creature as
he was, but I gave him a hunch of bread—I
always say that’s good enough for them if they’re
really hungry—and when he asked for something
more I just banged the door in his face, and I
took care to bolt it directly afterwards top and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bottom. It was a good two hours before the
usual time, but ever since my best umbrella was
stolen I’ve been downright scared of tramps. But
that isn’t all. The very next morning—yesterday
morning that is—Mr. Brown saw that same boy
or his twin brother lurking about near the garden-door,
for all the world as if he was waiting for
someone. He sent him to the rightabout pretty
quick. The only pity is he didn’t do it for good
and all, for I do believe it’s that boy that has led
away poor Master Micky.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t understand,’ said Miss Miller.
‘Whatever should he want Micky for?’</p>

<p>‘What do gipsies usually want children for?’ rejoined
Jane. ‘Maybe it’s for the sake of a reward,
or maybe they think they could train him to be
useful. Master Micky’d make a grand acrobat,
to judge from the way he turns coach-wheels.’</p>

<p>Gipsies and people who travelled with shows
were closely connected in Jane’s mind.</p>

<p>‘But are there any gipsies about?’ asked Miss
Miller.</p>

<p>‘Not the real Romanies, but plenty of the sort of
vagabonds that call themselves gipsies,’ said Jane.
‘There’s a van of them in a field at Baddicomb
at this very moment’—Baddicomb was a village
about five miles off—‘and one and another of
them have been wandering about the country-side
up to no end of mischief. Why, Mr. Warne got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his orchard robbed only yesterday by a boy that
he says certainly doesn’t belong hereabouts, and
that’s most likely one of them—most likely the
very same that’s got hold of Master Micky.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Miss Miller, ‘I think the best thing
for me to do is to ride into Chudstone again, and
suggest to the police that possibly the gipsies
have got hold of the boy.’</p>

<p>Miss Miller said nothing about where she was
going to either of her pupils. ‘If only I had not
to give two music-lessons this afternoon I would
have come back again to see how you are getting
on,’ she said to Emmeline as she wheeled her
bicycle out at the front door, ‘for I can’t bear not
to be with you when you’re in such trouble. Anyhow,
I shall ride over again after tea just to see
what’s happening. I expect Micky will have
turned up long before then,’ with which cheering
prophecy, spoken with more confidence than she
could altogether feel, she mounted her flashing
machine and rode off.</p>

<p>Kitty had rushed away somewhere by herself
as soon as she was free to do what she liked, and
Emmeline felt lonely and helpless as she stood in
the drive looking after her governess. There
seemed nothing she could do.</p>

<p>Stay! She would go up to her own room and
pray very, very hard that Micky might be found.
Perhaps that would succeed. At all events, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
would be better than this dreadful waiting and
doing nothing. Emmeline wondered that she
had not thought of it before.</p>

<p>She ran upstairs, but was rather taken aback to
find her bedroom occupied by Alice, who was
dusting the mantelpiece ornaments. To be sure,
she hurried out of the room as soon as the young
lady appeared, but not before Emmeline had seen
that her eyes were red and swollen. Emmeline
knelt down by her bedside, but, try as she would,
she could not fix her thoughts. They kept
wandering off to Alice.</p>

<p>That horrible money! The thought of it kept
haunting Emmeline like some tormenting demon.
She had almost forgotten it for a time in the
trouble of the morning, but now it kept coming
between her and her prayers. How could she
expect them to be answered so long as she was
deceiving everyone and letting Alice suffer under
a false accusation?</p>

<p>‘Nonsense,’ she told herself. ‘There’s no
deceiving in not telling that meddlesome Jane
what I did with my own extra money-box money!
I did tell her I was sure Alice hadn’t taken it, and
I don’t think really she meant to make any fuss
about it till Aunt Grace comes home. It <em>must</em> be
about Micky Alice is crying. Anyhow, Aunt
Grace is the person who really matters, not Jane,
and, if she suspects Alice, I’ll tell her that I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the money. It would be very unkind to bother
them about it just now when they’re in such
trouble. It would worry them dreadfully, for
they’d be certain to ask questions, and it would
all come out about Diamond Jubilee and his
having disappeared, too, and they’d be sure to
think Micky had run away with him, and then
they’d write and frighten poor Aunt Grace. No,
for Aunt Grace’s sake, I really can’t risk their
finding out about Diamond Jubilee till Micky’s
safe back.’</p>

<p>She was still trying to persuade herself that she
was justified in keeping silence about him, when
the door was burst open, and in rushed Kitty,
very untidy, and with short white hairs sticking
all over her dress. In her hand was an extremely
dirty, crumpled bit of paper, which looked as
if it might have been torn out of an exercise-book.</p>

<p>She closed the door with a care very unlike her
usual slap-dash ways, and came close up to Emmeline
before she whispered mysteriously:</p>

<p>‘Look what I’ve found in Punch’s kennel!
Mr. Brown had chained him up again, and I felt
so miserable that I just had to be with the darling.
He <em>is</em> such a comfort in trouble.’</p>

<p>Emmeline was not listening. She was staring
at some pencilled words scribbled on the torn
piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Dear Kitty’ (she read), ‘I am leving this
were you’ll be the person most likely to find it.
This is to tell you I am going back to grene
ginger land with dimund joublee. Hes jolly
well had enuf of this he ses, and so have I,
speshally after yestidday, wich show how beestly
everything will be with Jane to put peeple to
bed just for akserdents like the blankets. Besids
of corse as Im his adopted father I have to go
to, or how could I trane him. It will be a jolly
lark. Dont tell enyone were Ive gone except
you may Emmeline, as shes in it too, and don’t
greave for me too much dear sister. Your loving
bother, Micky.’</p>

<p>‘Does Micky mean he won’t ever come back
again?’ asked Kitty, with painful anxiety, as Emmeline
screwed up the paper into a little ball, and
began pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>Emmeline did not seem to hear, so Kitty
repeated the question in a voice which sounded
as though she were on the point of bursting
out crying out again.</p>

<p>‘No, of course not, you silly child,’ said Emmeline,
impatiently. ‘At least, it doesn’t matter
what he means—he won’t be allowed to, anyhow.
Kitty,’ she added penitently, ‘I didn’t mean to
be cross, only I’m so frightfully worried. It’s
dreadful to think where Diamond Jubilee may
be taking Micky to!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I wish we’d never met Diamond Jubilee!’
moaned Kitty.</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ agreed Emmeline from the bottom
of her heart; ‘but the question now is what to
do about Micky.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it would be betraying to tell any
of the grown-up people when he says I’m not
to?’ said Kitty, doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Emmeline. Her four years
of seniority made her view things rather differently,
but she had her own reasons for being
even more unwilling than Kitty to show Micky’s
letter to any of the elders. ‘No, I think we’d
much better not say anything yet,’ she added,
after a moment’s thought. ‘It’s not as if Aunt
Grace were here, or even Miss Miller. But it’s
only the servants, and they can’t care so very
much’—she was doing them great injustice—‘and
it would only make a horrible fuss and worry
them dreadfully. It will be much best for them
not to know where Micky has gone till he’s safe
back again.’</p>

<p>‘But how are we going to get him safe back
again?’ demanded Kitty, in a woeful voice.</p>

<p>‘I’m going into Eastwich myself this afternoon
to fetch him home,’ said Emmeline, with studied
coolness, though her heart was beating fast at the
thought of taking such an unheard-of step on her
own responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Emmeline!’ gasped Kitty, admiring,
frightened, and astonished all at once. ‘But
will they let you go?’ she added.</p>

<p>‘I shan’t ask them,’ said Emmeline. ‘It’s no
business of theirs. They won’t even know I’m
gone till tea-time, and by then Micky and I’ll
be coming home together, I expect.’</p>

<p>‘Emmeline, you’re the cleverest, darlingest
person in the world!’ cried Kitty, beginning an
ecstatic dance round the room—a dance which
stopped abruptly, however, as a sudden difficulty
flashed into her mind. ‘How are you going to
get money for a ticket?’ she asked.</p>

<p>Emmeline flushed a little.</p>

<p>‘There’s that eighteenpence Aunt Grace gave
you just before she went away for the chickens’
food,’ she said a little awkwardly. ‘You know
Cook said what they had would last for another
week, so do you mind lending it me? We shall
have our pocket-money in less than a week, you
know, and we can use it all for paying back
what we’ve borrowed from the chickens, for there
won’t be Diamond Jubilee to think of now.
I’m sure’s there’s no harm in just borrowing it for
something so frightfully important as finding
Micky.’</p>

<p>Kitty saw no harm at all in what Emmeline
thought right.</p>

<p>‘I suppose there wouldn’t be money enough for
me to go too?’ she suggested wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, there wouldn’t,’ said Emmeline; ‘you
must remember there’ll be Micky’s ticket back
to get as well as mine. Besides, I expect I shall
have to go into places that wouldn’t be at all fit
for you. I’m sure Green Ginger Land must be a
dreadful place.’</p>

<p>‘It sounds lovely!’ said Kitty, with a sigh;
but she submitted to Emmeline’s decision with
her usual sweet temper.</p>

<p>After all, so long as Micky came back that
evening—and Kitty had not the slightest doubt
that he would, since Emmeline said so—nothing
else mattered.</p>

<p>‘Emmeline,’ said Kitty, anxiously, when the
two were left alone together during dinner, ‘you
won’t bring Diamond Jubilee back as well as
Micky, will you?’</p>

<p>‘Not now he has run away,’ said Emmeline
sternly. ‘He’s been such a wicked, ungrateful boy
that I’m afraid we must leave him to his fate.
After all,’ she added reflectively, ‘<em>perhaps</em> we’re
rather too inexperienced to adopt children,’ which
was an admission such as Emmeline had never
yet made in the whole course of her life.</p>

<p>‘I am <em>so</em> glad!’ said Kitty, with a deep-drawn
sigh of relief.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">GREEN GINGER LAND</span></h2>

<p>As soon as dinner was over Emmeline set out
for Chudstone, for it was from there that she
meant to start on her expedition in search of
Micky.</p>

<p>Kitty went with her as far as the station. She
had pleaded to be allowed to do so, and Emmeline
consented the more readily because she was
glad just then to have other company than that of
her own thoughts. The servants saw the two
girls leaving the house together, but took it for
granted that they were merely going to play in
the wood, so no awkward questions were asked.</p>

<p>All the way to Chudstone Emmeline laughed
and chattered eagerly. She was trying hard to
pretend to herself that she was doing a right and
matter-of-course thing in setting off to Eastwich
to find her little brother, without saying a word to
any of the elders; but, if she had really thought so
at the bottom of her heart, she would not have
gone out of her way to take the train at
Chudstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t quite know what time the 2.10 gets to
Chudstone,’ she had remarked to Kitty, ‘but as it
must be a few minutes later than the time it leaves
Woodsleigh, it must be all right if I count it 2.10,
just as usual.’ The Wednesday 2.10 was well
known to Emmeline, for it was the special train
run for the weekly half-day excursion to Eastwich,
and Aunt Grace had sometimes travelled
by it.</p>

<p>‘I do wish I was big, too, and could come with
you, Emmeline!’ said Kitty, as she waited on
Chudstone platform, while Emmeline leaned out
of a carriage-window for those final words of
parting, which are so necessary to all railway-travellers,
and so inconvenient to the other people
already established in the compartment. ‘It will
be horribly dull all alone.’</p>

<p>‘You will have Punch, you know,’ Emmeline
reminded her—Punch had not been brought with
them, because his nervousness at railway-stations
was apt to show itself in ways which made his
friends nervous in their turn—‘and if you feel
lonely without me, you’ll just have to think that
I’m gone to fetch Micky home.’</p>

<p>The next moment the train was in motion, and
Emmeline was sinking back into her seat with
the echo of her own words ringing in her ears.
How grand and grown-up it sounded to be going
into Eastwich to fetch somebody home! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
could not help glancing at her travelling companions—an
elderly farmer’s wife, with a portly
figure and a profusion of jet ornaments, and a
flashy young woman who might be her daughter—to
see whether they were duly impressed. But
they seemed so much more interested in one
another than in Emmeline, that a dreary sense of
insignificance stole over her, and she began to find
it harder and harder to think of herself as an
important elder sister, instead of a lonely little
girl doing what most people would consider a
very naughty thing.</p>

<p>Half an hour’s journey in the train brought her
to Eastwich Station, where she alighted, feeling
strange and bewildered, and not quite sure what
to do next. A harassed porter jostled her with
an impatient ‘<em>If</em> you please!’ An agitated old
lady, whose luggage appeared to have somehow
misbehaved, begged her to ‘get out of my way,
little girl.’ Emmeline remembered the last time
she had been on that platform, when she had
been going to see Mary. For one moment she
felt half inclined to go to Mary now, and pour
out the story of all the troubles and mistakes and
naughtinesses of the last two days to her old nurse.
But then Mary would be so very much surprised
and disappointed in Emmeline. No, she <em>could</em>
not go there while Micky was still lost in Green
Ginger Land. Perhaps they would go to Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
when once she had brought him safe out of the
clutches of that dreadful Mother Grimes. It
would be so much easier to set things in a fair
light then.</p>

<p>Well, she supposed the first thing to do would
be to ask her way to Green Ginger Land. She
made the inquiry of a chance porter. ‘I’m sure I
don’t know, miss. Ask a policeman,’ was his
hurried and indifferent answer as he trundled away
a great barrowful of trunks and boxes.</p>

<p>Policemen seemed scarce in Eastwich that day,
and Emmeline had wandered some little way out
of the station before she came across one.</p>

<p>‘Green Ginger Land!’ he repeated, looking at
her oddly. ‘That’s not a fit place for a little lady
like you to go all alone.’</p>

<p>‘I know—I mean I can’t help it,’ said Emmeline.
‘But oh, <em>do</em> tell me where it is!’</p>

<p>He gave her the direction, which was a difficult
one, involving a formidable number of firsts to
right and thirds to the left, and then repeated
his warning. ‘But it really aren’t fit for the likes
of you to go there alone by yourself. I’d go with
you, only it’s out of my beat.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you; you are very kind,’ and Emmeline
hurried on for fear of further remonstrance.</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ walking brought her into a part
of Eastwich which was so strange to her and such
a network of squalid streets that she soon grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
confused. No other policeman came in sight, and
she began to feel worried as to what she should
do. She had always been warned against speaking
to strangers except those in uniform; and yet
she dared not go any further without asking her
way, for fear of losing herself.</p>

<p>Great was her relief when she saw a lady
coming towards her who looked as though she
might be a clergyman’s wife or a district visitor.
Her appearance was so severely respectable that
the rule of not speaking to strangers could not
apply in this case; so Emmeline went up to the
lady and asked timidly the way to Green Ginger
Land.</p>

<p>‘Green Ginger Land?’ said the stranger, eyeing
her severely. ‘You are surely not thinking
of going there?’</p>

<p>‘I—I was thinking of going there,’ stammered
Emmeline, confused and ashamed.</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s <em>most</em> unsuitable,’ said the stranger.
‘Green Ginger Land is not at <em>all</em> a nice street
for a little girl like you to go to. Why, even
policemen don’t walk there alone after dark!
Whatever makes you think of going there?’</p>

<p>Now, the sensible thing for Emmeline to have
done would have been to tell the simple truth,
and to say that she was going to look for her
little brother, but somehow the severe stranger’s
manner, together with what she said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Green Ginger Land being a dangerous place even
for policemen, frightened her out of all presence
of mind. At the moment Emmeline only felt in
a confused way how very angry and shocked the
lady would be if she guessed the truth, and it did
not strike her until afterwards that in itself
there was nothing in her little brother’s being in
Green Ginger Land which implied that it was
her fault.</p>

<p>‘I-I thought I’d like to,’ she faltered, turning
very red.</p>

<p>‘Then you’re a very silly little girl,’ said the
lady, even more severely than before. ‘Green
Ginger Land is a dreadful street, and you certainly
mustn’t <em>think</em> of going there’; and with
that she went on her way.</p>

<p>For a moment Emmeline felt shaken in her
purpose, but when the stranger’s straight back
had disappeared round the corner, she plucked
up courage. It was dreadful to think of going
to Green Ginger Land after what she had been
told, but it was still more dreadful that Micky
should be there partly through her fault; so
Emmeline resolved to make another effort to find
the way.</p>

<p>This time it was a ragged little girl whom she
asked. ‘Green Ginger Land? Just you turn by
that there public-house at the corner. Then it’s
the second on the right and the first on the left,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
said the child glibly, as she gave Emmeline a
cool stare of curiosity.</p>

<p>Five minutes more brought her to Green
Ginger Land itself. It was certainly an unattractive
place, but at first sight she was surprised
not to find it more terrible. To be sure, it
was dirtier and more smelly than any street to
which Emmeline was used, and there were swarms
of squalid children everywhere, and yet more
squalid women who stood at their doors gossiping
with arms akimbo; but still, she could not see that
there was anything of which a policeman or even
a little girl need feel afraid.</p>

<p>Her relief did not last very long. The women
left off gossiping with one another and turned to
stare after her, making remarks which she could
not quite catch, but the general tone of which
sounded unpleasant. Some of the children ceased
their play and began to follow her, calling out,
‘My! Aren’t we a bloomin’ swell!’ and other
sarcastic witticisms of the same order. Emmeline
grew frightened again, and resolved to get
her business over as quickly as might be.</p>

<p>‘Can you tell me where a Mrs. Grimes lives?’
she inquired timidly of a woman who looked a
degree more respectable than most of the others.</p>

<p>The woman gave her a rude stare. ‘I’m
sure I can’t say, my lady,’ she answered, with a
mincing imitation of Emmeline’s tones which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
produced a loud and disagreeable laugh. ‘May I
make so bold as to ask if you’re a friend of
hers?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Emmeline, flushing hotly, ‘but I
believe my little brother’s at her house, and I
want to fetch him home.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed! Well, I believe she resides
somewhere down Paradise Court, just across the
road there, but I can’t say as to the number, and
I wouldn’t go there if I was you. Mrs. Grimes
is a lady that don’t always like company.’ Again
there was a roar of rude laughter from the people
standing round.</p>

<p>Emmeline looked across the road to where the
woman had pointed, and saw that what at a
casual glance she had taken for a doorway was
really an opening leading down steps into a long
narrow court. Seen from where she stood, it
did not look at all a nice place, but Emmeline
screwed up her courage, and, crossing the road
without another word, went cautiously down the
dirty, broken steps into Paradise Court, still
followed by her mob of jeering children.</p>

<p>If Green Ginger Land itself was smelly,
Paradise Court in its dark narrowness was so
foul that Emmeline might have covered her nose
if she had not been too intent on avoiding the
filthy, half-naked babies who were sprawling
about everywhere to pay much heed to anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
else. What she did notice, however, was that
evil-looking men and lads were appearing at
several of the doors.</p>

<p>Suddenly a stone came whizzing through the
air from behind, almost, though not quite, hitting
her. A great shout of cruel laughter burst from
the mob of children—laughter in which more than
one hoarse man’s voice joined.</p>

<p>‘O, God, help me to be brave! Help me not
to run away!’ prayed Emmeline in desperate
terror.</p>

<p>Another stone flew past her, and the shouts
became louder. Hardly knowing what she did,
she made blindly for a door, and thumped at it
madly. After what seemed like an eternity,
though it was really only a second or two, a
woman’s face was poked out.</p>

<p>‘Oh, please,’ said Emmeline, ‘is this where
Mrs. Grimes lives?’</p>

<p>‘No, it ain’t,’ said the woman sharply, and
before Emmeline could get out anything more
she slammed the door in her face.</p>

<p>Emmeline felt as though she were living
through some horrible nightmare. In front of
her was the closed door; behind her the jeering
crowd of children seemed to her terrified senses
to be a howling, murderous mob.</p>

<p>Another cruel stone which only just missed
made her cower with her head between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hands. ‘Oh, help me not to run away!’ she
prayed again.</p>

<p>‘What’s up? What are you doing of, you
little varmints?’ called out a rough, but not unkindly
voice close to her. Looking up, she saw
a stout young man of truculent aspect standing at
her side. ‘Just you leave this young lady alone,
or I’ll break every bone in your bodies!’ he continued
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Perhaps Emmeline’s tormentors knew by experience
that the young man’s rough words were
no mere figure of speech, for they slunk back, and
one little boy who had just been to the road to
pick up another stone thought better of it and
dropped it on the pavement. ‘I’m bothered
if Bully Ben ain’t turning a blooming saint!’
called out a bold spirit; and there were other
remarks of the same kind, which did not, however,
seem in the least to disturb Bully Ben’s
serenity.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing here?’ he demanded of
Emmeline. ‘You’d have had a rough time of it,
I can tell you, if I hadn’t have come out.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Emmeline, almost in tears—somehow
it seemed harder not to break down
now that the great danger appeared to be over—‘it
was so very, very good of you, and I do
thank you! But oh, can you tell me where
a Mother Grimes lives? I believe my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
brother’s at her house, and I’ve come to look for
him.’</p>

<p>‘Mother Grimes?’ said the youth, ‘why, she’s
a pal of mine. But what have your little
brother gone there for? Judging by you, he
won’t be the sort of lodger that’s much in <em>her</em>
line.’</p>

<p>‘He ran away with a boy named Diamond
Jubilee Jones, whom we’d—I mean, he’d come to
stay with us for a day or two,’ explained Emmeline,
rather confusedly. ‘I suppose you haven’t
happened to see him anywhere?’</p>

<p>‘I seed him not an hour ago, and a little chap
with him that must have been your brother,’
said Bully Ben promptly. ‘They told me they
was off to the Fair, an’ wouldn’t be back till
tea-time.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you!’ cried Emmeline. ‘I’ll go
there to find him, then.’</p>

<p>‘I reckon I’ll just see you safe out of these
parts,’ said Bully Ben graciously—an offer
which she was only too thankful to accept,
for those dreadful children were still lingering
about, as though waiting to renew the attack
as soon as Bully Ben’s broad back should be
turned.</p>

<p>Emmeline stole timid side-glances at her burly
escort as they two left Paradise Court together,
with a crowd of derisive children in the rear—at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a safe distance. He looked an extremely rough
type of lad, and Emmeline had just decided that
he was like one of those burglars in stories, whose
hearts are always touched by innocent and helpless
children, when he asked her the time.</p>

<p>The question, though rather unexpected,
sounded harmless enough, so Emmeline pulled
out her beloved little gold watch, and politely
gave him the information he required.</p>

<p>‘That’s a rare fine watch,’ he remarked. ‘Let’s
have a look at that.’</p>

<p>It was impossible to refuse her brave rescuer
such a trifling request, so she put the watch into
one of his very grimy hands.</p>

<p>‘Much obliged to you!’ he said, with a good-natured
laugh. ‘So long!’ and before Emmeline,
in her amazement, had realised what was
happening, he had slipped back into Paradise
Court.</p>

<p>For an instant she gazed blankly, scarcely believing
her own senses. Then a roar of laughter
from the onlookers maddened her into recklessness,
and she was just going to rush down the
steps again in pursuit of Bully Ben, when someone
caught her firmly by the sleeve and held her
back.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you never go in there again,’ whispered
a girl’s voice in her ear. ’Tisn’t safe. There was
a preaching bloke got his head split open in there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
only last Sunday. Just you run away before
there’s anything worse happens.’</p>

<p>The speaker was ragged and dirty, like everyone
else in Green Ginger Land, and Emmeline
was more than half-inclined to take her for an
accomplice of Bully Ben’s, and to disregard the
warning. She hesitated, equally unable to make
up her mind to resign her watch, or to screw up
her courage to plunge back into that terrible
court, and as she wavered the children began to
gather close again.</p>

<p>‘Just you run away,’ said the girl more urgently
than before.</p>

<p>It is hard to say what would have happened
if Emmeline had not just then felt something
sting her cheek. It was only a piece of banana-peel,
but such a yell of triumph rose from the
spectators that she was seized with panic and
fled headlong, pursued by the howling mob of
children.</p>

<p>On and on she ran, still seeming to hear the
shouts of her pursuers, till she had got far outside
the borders of Green Ginger Land. Still she ran
blindly on, till at last she was brought to a sudden
standstill by bumping so violently against a fat
old lady as almost to knock her down.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ ejaculated the old lady, as soon as she
had regained her breath, ‘you <em>are</em> a rude little
girl!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’m—so—sorry,’ panted Emmeline: ‘some
people—are chasing me—with stones.’</p>

<p>‘There’s nobody chasing you,’ said the old lady
severely, and when Emmeline looked round she
saw that it was the truth. The Green Ginger
children had all straggled back to their own land
before this.</p>

<p>‘It’s just one of those rude games you
children are always playing about the streets,’
grumbled the old lady. ‘I’m sure I don’t know
what girls are coming to.’</p>

<p>Poor Emmeline! She had never in her life
before been suspected of playing rude games in
the streets, but she had not the heart to defend
herself, so she walked on without another word.
As she walked, the thought of her lost watch—that
dear little watch which had been her mother’s
very last gift—came back to her like a stab, and
made her eyes fill with tears till everything
became blurred, and she stumbled along not seeing
where she was going.</p>

<p>But she was a plucky little soul at the bottom,
not given to crying over spilt milk when there
were more urgent things to be done, so, as her
handkerchief had got lost in the course of her
adventures, she wiped her eyes on the back of
her glove.</p>

<p>‘After all, it’s only right you should have <em>some</em>
punishment, for you oughtn’t to have come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Eastwich without leave,’ she told herself, with
something of that stern sense of justice with which
she had been wont to govern the twins. ‘And,
anyhow, the thing that really matters is to find
Micky, so what you’ve got to do now is to ask the
way to the Fair.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">MICKY AT THE FAIR</span></h2>

<p>The two policemen at Chudstone were feeling
extremely puzzled.</p>

<p>It seemed so impossible that a boy of eight,
supposed to have left home only that morning
with little or no money, could have gone very
far, and yet how was it, if he were anywhere in the
neighbourhood, that nobody had yet succeeded
in finding him?</p>

<p>There were no rivers within several miles of
Woodsleigh, and even the horse-ponds were
shallow, so that Micky could not well have
been drowned; if he had been run over by a
motor-car his mangled body would surely have
been discovered before now; and as to the possibility
of his having been stolen by gipsies, a raid
upon the Baddicomb van had made it clear that
that theory, at least, was without foundation.
Under the circumstances it seemed extraordinary,
not to say magical, that the boy had so utterly
and absolutely disappeared.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
magical or even extraordinary in the business.
Micky had simply gone to Eastwich, and he had
travelled there not on a broom-stick, but part of the
way on his own legs, and the other part hanging on
to the back of a cart, which was taking some noisily
aggrieved pigs for their last sad drive to the pork
butcher’s.</p>

<p>The real reason why nobody had managed to
track him was twofold—firstly, he had had about
twelve hours’ more start than his friends fancied,
having left home not on Wednesday morning, but
at half-past seven on Tuesday evening; and
secondly, people were on the look out for one
little gentleman, whereas it should have been for
two little tramps!</p>

<p>‘Don’t I make a splendid beggar?’ Micky had
demanded triumphantly, the evening before, when
he had jumped out to join Diamond Jubilee, who
was waiting just underneath his window—and the
boast was no vain one. It is wonderful how a
quick-witted boy can transform himself by dint
of changing a neat sailor-suit for a ragged old
coat and pair of knickers put away in the lumber-room,
dispensing with collar, shoes, and stockings,
and muddying his face and hands with flower-bed
earth (‘you have to lick it to make it stick,’
Micky was careful to explain when he told the
story afterwards); and all these things Micky had
done, with the result that he looked every bit as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
much of a little tramp as Diamond Jubilee
himself.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t many men who’d have thought of
waiting quietly in bed till the servants were safe
out of the house,’ Micky had remarked complacently,
as he and Diamond Jubilee were setting
out, ‘and I don’t suppose most people would have
known how to disguise themselves so well. It’s
really a beautifully managed adventure.’</p>

<p>In Diamond Jubilee’s eyes the adventure had
needed only one improvement.</p>

<p>‘I could do with a bit of something to eat afore
we starts,’ he had suggested.</p>

<p>‘But Jane said I wasn’t to have my proper
supper to-night, and of course we can’t take anything,
for that would be stealing,’ said Micky, not
in the least meaning to lecture, but simply to state
a matter of fact.</p>

<p>‘You <em>are</em> a softy!’ said Diamond Jubilee, but
he spoke in quite an affectionate tone and did not
press the point further. It was strange how
different he was when alone with Micky, from
what he was when Emmeline was trying to improve
him.</p>

<p>‘What have you done with your monkey-nuts?’
Micky had asked.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I just throwed ’em away. I were that
sick of ’em, an’ they’d have been an awful fag to
carry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You <em>are</em> a slacker, Diamond Jubilee!’ said
Micky. ‘Why, just look at me, carrying a whole
suit besides my shoes and stockings!’ It had
occurred to Micky that he had better take his discarded
sailor-suit and shoes and stockings with
him, as they would be the handiest things to sell
in case he found himself in need of money.
It really was, as he said, a beautifully managed
adventure!</p>

<p>None of the little Boltons had worn shoes or
stockings for the first six years of their lives, so
that Micky’s feet were too thoroughly hardened
to mind stones or anything else, and the children
did the first two miles of their journey at a good
swinging pace, the more so, that there are plenty of
sign-posts in that part of the country, so they did
not have to stop and ask the way. During the
third mile Diamond Jubilee began to flag badly,
and Micky was secretly repenting the foresight
which had given him such a troublesome bundle
to carry; and at the beginning of the fourth mile
both boys agreed that they must rest somewhere
for the night before going on any farther.</p>

<p>They were just at that moment passing a
farmhouse, one of the outbuildings of which proved
on inspection to be a barn with some straw in it.
What better sleeping-place could have been desired?
The boys went in, nestled down amongst
the straw, and dozed off as soundly as a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
little tops. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the
lowing of the cows woke them up next morning
before anyone had come in to find them, and they
stole out again, feeling wonderfully refreshed and
quite ready for the remaining nine miles of their
walk. They had already gone one of those miles
before Micky suddenly remembered that he had
left the bundle of his suit and shoes and stockings
behind in the barn. It did not seem worth while
to go back and fetch them, however, especially as
they were such a bother to carry.</p>

<p>It could not have been more than about five
o’clock when the boys set out again, but they
made most of the remainder of their journey in
so leisurely a fashion that it was past three in
the afternoon before they were well into Eastwich,
and they would have been later still had
it not been for the secret lift which they obtained
by hanging on to the pigs’ cart for the last two
miles of the way. What they had been doing all
the time it would have been hard to say; they had
begged their breakfast at one farm and their lunch
at another—neither meal was more than a drink
of water and a hunch of bread each, but the bread
tasted delicious, eaten under the hedge, after that
long, hungry walk; they had played about; Micky
had had such a successful fight with a little boy
who had called after them, that Diamond Jubilee
held out hopes that he might eventually develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
into the same kind of person as a certain friend
of his, who had, he said, ‘been in quod fifteen
times for fighting, and would knock a chap down
sooner than look at him’; and they had passed
the time of day with most of the animals they
met; but still, even allowing for all this, it must be
owned that their progress was decidedly slow.</p>

<p>‘I reckon,’ remarked Diamond Jubilee, when
at last they did find themselves strolling through
the streets of Eastwich—it was at just about
same time that Emmeline was making her way
to Green Ginger Land—‘I reckon we’d better
get some money afore we go to Mother Grimes’.
She aren’t pleased if you come in without money,
or wipes, or such, and sometimes she beat you
something awful.’</p>

<p>Micky had not the slightest idea what ‘wipes’
might be, but he was not going to give himself
away by asking.</p>

<p>‘Does she ever go on beating you till you
bleed?’ he inquired with interest. He had never
been beaten in his life, and was not in the least
dismayed at the prospect, as a more experienced
little boy might have been. On the contrary,
he regarded it as adding just that touch of danger
without which no adventure is complete.</p>

<p>‘I’ve bled whole basins’ full before now!’
boasted Diamond Jubilee. ‘It aren’t much of a
treat, I can tell you, when once Mother Grimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
starts a good old set-to, so I reckon we’ll go to
the Fair for a bit and do coach-wheels for the
folks to throw us money before we go home.’</p>

<p>This plan exactly suited Micky, and to the
Fair they accordingly went.</p>

<p>So it came about that Micky presently found
himself once more in the midst of all that delightful
noise and bustle which made up Eastwich
Fair. He would turn his very best coach-wheels,
he decided, and earn quantities of pennies for
motor-rides and ice-cream (last time Emmeline
wouldn’t let them have any because people had to
lick it out of glasses, as there were no spoons)
and cocoanut-shies, and visits to the elephants.
<em>He</em> wasn’t going to give all his money to that
old Mother Grimes, whatever Diamond Jubilee
might do.</p>

<p>To all appearance that young gentleman was
in no great hurry to do anything, for he would
keep loitering about in an idle way long after
Micky had begun turning coach-wheels. Micky
told him he was a slacker, but it made no
difference.</p>

<p>Quite a little crowd gathered to watch Micky.</p>

<p>‘Don’t the little chap do it well?’ ‘Just look at
the poor lamb’s bare feet?’ ‘He’d be a real pretty
child if his face weren’t so dirty.’ ‘Don’t he thank
you pretty?’</p>

<p>Those were some of the remarks people made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as they threw down their halfpence, and for each
coin Micky said, ‘Thank you very much, ma’am!’
or ‘Thank you very much, sir!’ with the utmost
politeness, whichever way up he happened to be.</p>

<p>He had earned a small harvest of halfpence,
and the little exhibition was still going on as
merrily as a marriage-bell, when the dreadful thing
happened.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ve been keeping my eye on you two
young rascals. I know your little game!’ said a
stern, startling voice.</p>

<p>Micky spun himself right way up in double-quick
time, and what was his surprise and horror
to see Diamond Jubilee struggling in the grip
of a tall policeman!</p>

<p>‘Please, sir, I’d only just picked it up to give
it back to the lady,’ Diamond Jubilee was whimpering.
‘She’d dropped it on the ground, please
sir.’</p>

<p>‘There’s no use telling any lies about it,’ said
the policeman, ‘for I saw you take the handkerchief
out of the lady’s pocket with my own eyes.
You’ll just come along of me—and you too,’ he
added, suddenly using his free hand to seize hold
of the astonished Micky.</p>

<p>‘It’s all a mistake,’ gasped Micky. ‘On my
word and honour as a gentleman we weren’t
doing anything—I mean we were only turning
coach-wheels—at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>——’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I saw you turning coach-wheels to take
off attention from what your friend was doing,’
was the gruff answer. ‘I know the dodge. It’s
just the way you little thieves always work.’</p>

<p>Micky’s face turned very white under its dirt.</p>

<p>‘We’re not thieves!’ he began hotly, but suddenly
broke off. He could not say truthfully that
Diamond Jubilee was not a thief, and it would be
sneakish to stand up for himself at Diamond
Jubilee’s expense. So Micky pressed his lips
tightly together, and tried hard to keep them
from quivering. He was not going to cry like a
baby before all these people.</p>

<p>‘I shall have to take down your name and
address, ma’am,’ said the policeman to a
frightened-looking lady who was standing near,
and whom Micky now noticed for the first time,
‘for you’ll be wanted to prosecute these boys.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t want to be hard on such children,
especially as I’ve got the handkerchief back,’ she
answered nervously.</p>

<p>‘It will be the best possible thing for them,’ he
answered in a low voice; ‘they belong to a regular
thieves’ school, and we’ve been watching long
enough for an opportunity of breaking it up. Will
you kindly hold the boys while I write the address?’
he added aloud to a stout young man.</p>

<p>The stout young man came forward willingly
enough and took hold of an arm of each boy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a firm grip from which Diamond Jubilee tried
vainly to wriggle away. As for Micky, he stood
as still as a little statue, and held his head high.</p>

<p>It only took a moment for the policeman to
write down the address in a notebook which he
whipped out of his pocket; and then with a
peremptory ‘Make way there, please!’ to the
bystanders, he took the two boys from the young
man who was holding them and began marching
them out of the Fair ground, followed by a large
crowd.</p>

<p>Neither child made any attempt now to
struggle away, but Micky’s childish face had a
look of set misery which went to the hearts of all
the mothers who saw it, and presently struck even
Diamond Jubilee.</p>

<p>Now Diamond Jubilee, though a very naughty
boy, was not altogether a hardened one, and that
expression on Micky’s face made him feel distinctly
uncomfortable. Micky had been a great
softy not to stand up for himself—Diamond
Jubilee, or any other sensible kid, would have
jolly soon thrown the blame on the other chap if
there had been the least chance of being believed—but
some folks were born softies, and couldn’t
help it. Anyhow, Diamond Jubilee liked Micky,
and couldn’t abide his looking like that.</p>

<p>‘Please, sir, the other boy didn’t have nothing
to do with it; he were only doing coach-wheels so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as folks should throw him halfpennies,’ broke out
Diamond Jubilee all of a sudden.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say he didn’t know what you
were up to?’ asked the policeman in an incredulous
voice.</p>

<p>That question spoilt it. To own that he himself
had been up to anything was more than could
be expected of Diamond Jubilee’s generosity. ‘I
weren’t up to nothing,’ he whined; ‘I’m sure I
never took the wipe. All I done were to pick it
up to give the lady.’</p>

<p>‘Now, there’s no use in going back to that silly
lie,’ said the policeman sharply, ‘for I saw you
pull it out myself.’ For an instant his belief in
Micky’s being an accomplice had been somewhat
shaken—though the boy would surely have joined
in defending himself if his conscience had been
clear—but this last untruth made him set Diamond
Jubilee down as an inveterate little liar whose
testimony was worth nothing at all. When the
child began to repeat the assertion that the other
boy anyhow had had nothing to do with it, he
was silenced at once with a stern ‘I can’t believe
anything you say.’</p>

<p>As to Micky, he said not a word, partly out of a
sense of chivalry towards Diamond Jubilee—if it
would have been sneakish before to leave him to
bear all the blame, it would be far worse now that
he had been so decent—and partly because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was too proud to stand up for himself when he
was sure to be disbelieved.</p>

<p>As the two boys and the policeman walked
along more and more people kept rushing out
from side streets to see what was happening, until
it seemed to poor Micky that all Eastwich must
be there to witness his disgrace. Well, as soon
as ever he was free again, he should flee the
country, he resolved fiercely. It would be unbearable
to live any longer in a land where such
thousands of people—Micky felt sure there must
be thousands at least—where such thousands
of people came to stare at you being taken to
prison.</p>

<p>Before they had gone far, the policeman stopped
at the door of a tall grim building with many
windows, some of which had bars. Into this grim
building he took the boys.</p>

<p class="tb">The crowd of gazers was just beginning to
scatter, when a white-faced little girl, whose eyes
were wide open with terror and dismay, came
running up breathlessly from the opposite direction
from the one in which the Fair lay. She
looked about her distractedly as if she were
hoping against hope to see somebody, and then
leaned heavily against the wall of the tall grim
building as though trying to steady herself.</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s a lesson what happens to bad boys,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a voice was saying—to the white-faced little girl
it seemed to come from somewhere a long, long
way off—‘How would you like to go to prison,
Jemmy?’</p>

<p>Prison! Oh, then the awful, unbelievable thing
<em>had</em> happened! That tall grim house was a prison.
It was to prison that she had seen the policeman
taking Micky and Diamond Jubilee. ‘Those two
little boys who’ve just gone in—in there,’ Emmeline
(for she it was) heard herself saying jerkily to
the voice which sounded so far away—‘what had
they been doing?’</p>

<p>The owner of the voice, a careworn lad who
was standing with his little brother almost at her
elbow, turned round and stared at Emmeline’s
pale, scared face. ‘They were caught at the Fair
picking pockets,’ he told her bluntly. It did not
occur to him that there was any need to speak
with caution of two little street-urchins who could
have no possible connection with this well-dressed
child.</p>

<p class="tb">Emmeline found herself running madly through
the streets of Eastwich in the direction of Mary’s
house; running as she might have run if Micky
had been drowning, or she had been bound on
some other errand of life or death. What she
expected Mary to be able to do she could not
have told—even grown-ups could not rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
people from prison—but the blind instinct of
going to her old friend for help in this terrible
trouble made her rush on, panting and sobbing,
heedless of the many people against whom she
knocked and who turned to stare after her in
indignant or pitying surprise. She began crossing
a road without noticing a tradesman’s cart which
was galloping out of a side street; neither did she
hear the driver’s horrified shout of ‘Hi!’ as he tried
vainly to pull up his horse in time. All she was
conscious of was of suddenly being thrown to the
ground, and then of a blow on her head and a
frightful pain in her arm. Afterwards everything
became dark, and she knew no more.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">EMMELINE TALKS THINGS OVER</span></h2>

<p>Emmeline opened her eyes again to find herself
half sitting, half lying across the seat of a cab. A
strange lady with a grave, kind face was kneeling
by her side, holding her arm.</p>

<p>‘Where—’ began Emmeline faintly, breaking
off with a groan as the cab gave a jolt and she felt
a sudden shoot of pain rather like having a tooth
out, only it was much worse, and in her arm, not
her mouth.</p>

<p>‘We are going to the Infirmary,’ said the lady
gently; ‘they’ll soon make you well.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t we go to Mary?’ said Emmeline, so
feebly that the lady could not quite catch the
words.</p>

<p>‘You shall go home as soon as ever the doctor
has put your arm right,’ she promised.</p>

<p>After that the pain grew so bad that there was
nothing for it but just to lie back on the seat and
squeeze her lips tightly together so as to keep
from screaming. At that moment she did not
care where she was going if only she got there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
soon, and this dreadful jolting drive came to
an end.</p>

<p>After a few minutes that seemed almost like as
many hours the cab stopped, and then somebody
came and lifted her out with strong, careful arms.
She must have fainted again after that, for the
next thing she knew was that she was lying on a
bed in a strange room, and that a doctor was
leaning over her, hurting her horribly by feeling
her arm.</p>

<p>‘Only a simple fracture,’ he remarked cheerfully.
‘We shall soon set that to rights.’</p>

<p>It was all very well for the doctor to speak
cheerfully, but the process of having her arm
set gave Emmeline the sharpest pain she had
ever known. One agonised ‘Oh!’ did burst from
her, but except for that she lay quite still and
quiet, only breathing harder than usual.</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re one of the pluckiest little things
I’ve ever had to do with,’ said the doctor warmly,
when he had finished his work.</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed she is,’ agreed the Nurse who had
helped to bind up the arm.</p>

<p>Emmeline gave a wan little smile. ‘One must
be—game,’ she remarked. ‘Game’ was one of
Micky’s words which she would never have used
if she had been quite herself.</p>

<p>‘Well, you have been very game!’ said the
doctor smiling as he left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards the Nurse began to undress her.
Emmeline had a dreamy impression that the
proceeding was a strange one, and that there was
something very important she ought to have
been doing, but she could not remember what
it was, and she felt so tired and so much disinclined
to argue that she just submitted without a
word.</p>

<p>‘Now, dear, can you tell me your name and
where you live?’ asked the Nurse, as she put
Emmeline into the narrow spring-bed on which
she had lain to have her arm set.</p>

<p>‘My name’s Emmeline Bolton,’ was the prompt
answer, ‘and I live——’ She hesitated, frowned
with perplexity, and then broke into a weak little
laugh. ‘Why, how funny! I can’t remember
the name of the place.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you live in Eastwich, then?’ asked the
Nurse.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t think we live there now,’ said
Emmeline in a puzzled way. ‘Mary does, though,’
she added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember Mary’s address and what
her surname is?’</p>

<p>Emmeline frowned again.</p>

<p>‘It’s very odd,’ she said after a moment. ‘I
don’t seem able to remember anything to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said the Nurse, ‘it’ll all come
back to you soon enough.’ She went out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
room and returned presently with a glass of
warm milk. ‘Drink this,’ she said, ‘and then go
to sleep like a good child.’</p>

<p>Emmeline drained the glass obediently, after
which she dropped her head back on to the
pillow, and in another minute she had fallen sound
asleep.</p>

<p>‘Poor little thing!’ said the Nurse to herself as
she went away. ‘She’s still dazed with the blow
on her head. Well, it can’t have been a very bad
one, or she wouldn’t have remembered as much
as she did, so I dare say she’ll be pretty well
all right by to-morrow. For to-night all we can
do is to give notice at the police-station that she is
here.’</p>

<p>Emmeline awoke the next morning to find the
sunlight pouring full into the room where she
was lying—a strange room with three empty beds
in it instead of Kitty’s, and none of the familiar
pictures nor furniture. Her first feeling was one
of bewilderment as to where she was, and why one
of her arms felt so funny. Then she remembered
that this was Eastwich Infirmary, and that she
had been brought there in a cab to have her arm
put to rights.</p>

<p>What had she been doing in Eastwich? For
a moment she could not think. Then suddenly
all the events of the last few days flashed back
upon her, up to the time when she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
standing talking to the stranger boy outside the
tall grim house, into which the policeman had
just led Micky and Diamond Jubilee!</p>

<p>When the Nurse came in to attend to her a
few minutes later, there was nothing to be seen
of Emmeline but a restless lump, heaving about
stormily underneath the bedclothes.</p>

<p>‘It’s very bad for the child to lie with her
head covered up like that,’ thought the Nurse, and,
going up to the bed, she tried gently to pull down
the clothes. For a moment Emmeline held on
fiercely, and when she did let her face be uncovered
it was tear-stained and flushed.</p>

<p>‘Well, how are you feeling this morning?’ asked
the Nurse kindly, ignoring the marks of tears.
She was quite used to patients being miserably
shy and homesick just at first.</p>

<p>‘Better, thank you—I mean quite well,’ said
Emmeline. ‘Please, I can’t stay here,’ she went
on. ‘There’s something dreadfully important I
must tell my friends. I can’t think how I came
to forget it last night. I must dress and go to
them now, at once. You don’t know how frightfully
it matters!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so unhappy,’ said Nurse. ‘We’ll
send for your friend, and I daresay she’ll be here
almost as soon as you’ve finished your breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you!’ said Emmeline, as much
relieved as she could be just then. ‘It’s Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Mary Bell I want to see, and her address is
14, East Parade.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said the Nurse. ‘Her brother was
round late last night inquiring after you. They
had found out at the police-station where you
were, and were very anxious about you, so mind
you eat a good breakfast and look as well as
possible when your friend comes, so as to set her
mind at rest,’ and Nurse went away with a merry
smile which poor Emmeline felt quite incapable of
returning.</p>

<p>Events turned out even better than Nurse’s
word. Emmeline was still struggling with her
basin of arrowroot, when the sound of a voice in
the passage outside made her flush and tremble
all over. Then the door opened, and Nurse
entered, followed by Mary, who hobbled in looking
anxious and worried, but otherwise so much her
motherly self that there would have been comfort
in the very sight of her if Emmeline had been less
taken up with the thought of the terrible news she
must tell.</p>

<p>‘Well, my poor darling, you have been through
a lot!’ said Mary, coming close to the bed and
bending down to kiss Emmeline’s quivering
face.</p>

<p>The kindly tone was too much for Emmeline,
and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>‘You won’t want to k-kiss me when you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
heard what dreadful things have happened all
through m-me!’ she sobbed.</p>

<p>‘There, there, my darling. Don’t take on so!’
said Mary, kissing her again. ‘Things aren’t so
bad as what you think. Master Micky have been
found.’</p>

<p>‘But, Mary,’ she broke out desperately, ‘he’s in
<em>prison</em>. I saw a policeman take him there yesterday
afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, dear,’ Mary hastened to explain, ‘not
to prison, only to the police-station. People can’t
be sent to prison till they have been tried in court,
you know. Micky didn’t stay long even at the
police-station, for as soon as he gave his name
and address they knew he must be the boy who
was missing, and sent for me to take him away.’</p>

<p>‘And is that really all that will happen,’ cried
Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Well, he’s had to go to the police-court this
morning to be questioned by the magistrate,’ Mary
was forced to admit. ‘But I quite hope he will get
on all right. Nobody could talk to him without
seeing what an honest little boy he is really,
and that he didn’t a bit understand what that
Diamond Jubilee was up to. That Diamond
Jubilee is a real bad boy, if ever there was one!’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid he is,’ said Emmeline sorrowfully.
‘It’s a dreadful pity Micky ever got mixed up
with him. And oh, Mary, it’s all my fault that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ever did! That’s what I was going to tell you
about.’</p>

<p>‘I think Master Micky has told me,’ said Mary.
‘You mean about adopting that boy unbeknown
to Miss Bolton. I must say I was surprised to
hear it of <em>you</em>, Miss Emmeline. I should never
have thought you would have done anything so
silly—to say nothing of its being very naughty
to do such a thing without leave.’</p>

<p>‘You see,’ faltered Emmeline, ‘I knew Aunt
Grace wouldn’t understand or sympathise with
us trying to do a good work.’</p>

<p>‘And I don’t blame her either,’ said Mary.
‘Not good works of that kind. They’re not
suitable to children.’</p>

<p>Poor Emmeline felt as though her one friend
had gone over to the enemy. Mary’s remark
was almost exactly what Aunt Grace had said
last Sunday, when Emmeline had been so indignant
with her for not appreciating that charitable
little Kathleen.</p>

<p>‘But, Mary,’ she said piteously. ‘You <em>did</em>
say yourself that guileless children could do more
good to sinners than anybody else, and I’m sure
Diamond Jubilee is a sinner!’</p>

<p>Mary looked as much taken aback as people
usually do when their own theories are put by
others into inconvenient practice.</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t thinking of adoption when I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
that,’ she explained rather lamely. ‘Specially
not a nasty, dirty little boy like that, who isn’t at
all fit company for little ladies and gentlemen.
But there, my darling, I don’t want to scold you,
for I’m sure you meant well, and anyhow, you’ve
been punished more than enough already, both
for adopting the boy, and also for running away to
find Micky, which is another thing you would
never have done if you had stopped to think
how dreadfully anxious and unhappy it would
make everybody.’</p>

<p>‘Did it?’ and Emmeline looked self-reproachful;
‘but there wasn’t anyone at home who would
mind much. It isn’t as if Jane and Cook cared for
us as you do, Mary.’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t likely they should, but for all that they
were nearly frightened out of their wits, poor
things,’ said Mary, ‘specially after Miss Miller
had got out of Kitty that you’d gone to Green
Ginger Land to look for Master Micky.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know all this?’ asked Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘I had a letter from Jane this morning, and a
telegram from Miss Miller yesterday evening,’
answered Mary.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I see now that I oughtn’t to have gone
off like that,’ said Emmeline sadly. ‘But I was
so dreadfully unhappy about Micky that nothing
seemed to matter except finding him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary was too kind to point out to Emmeline
that Micky would have been found just as soon if
she had never made her expedition.</p>

<p>‘Yes, poor darling, I can just fancy what you
must have been feeling!’ she said, ‘George would
have left a message for you last night about
Master Micky, only while he’s in this trouble it
seems best not to make any more talk than can be
helped, so I thought I’d come round and tell you
first thing this morning instead, and see how you
were at the same time. How did you come to
get run over?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t remember anything about it, it seems
just wiped out of my mind,’ said Emmeline; ‘it’s
very funny, for I remember the early part of the
afternoon so well. Oh, Mary, it was just like a
dreadful dream!’</p>

<p>Then she went on to tell of her adventures in
Green Ginger Land.</p>

<p>Mary shuddered as she listened, for she knew
far better than Emmeline herself what a risk the
child had run.</p>

<p>‘Thank God nothing worse happened than your
watch being stolen!’ she exclaimed from the
bottom of her heart when she had heard the whole
story. ‘That’s very grieving, though. But maybe
the police will be able to get it back for you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think the police will get me back
my watch?’ cried Emmeline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, you mustn’t reckon on it, but I can’t
help hoping they may,’ said Mary. ‘And now,
my darling, I must be going, for Master Micky’s
case will be getting over, and I must go and hear
how the poor lamb got on.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll come back and tell me as soon as
ever you know anything, won’t you?’ pleaded
Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘I expect your aunt will want to come herself,
dear, but if she doesn’t, I certainly will,’ answered
Mary.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace!’ exclaimed Emmeline. ‘Why,
she isn’t here. She’s in London!’</p>

<p>‘She’s here now,’ said Mary. ‘Miss Miller
telegraphed for her yesterday evening, and when
she reached home, about two o’clock this morning,
she found a telegram from George to say that both
you and Micky were at Eastwich, and that you
had had an accident. So she came back here by
the seven o’clock train.’</p>

<p>‘How dreadfully tired she must be!’ exclaimed
Emmeline. ‘And how could she leave her friend?’</p>

<p>‘The poor lady died yesterday afternoon,’ said
Mary in a low voice. ‘The end came much more
suddenly than anyone expected.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mary, I wish it hadn’t all happened just
yesterday!’ said Emmeline, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘So do I, dear,’ said Mary. ‘But it’s no use
crying over spilt milk. The only thing for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to do now is to tell your Aunt Grace how very
sorry you are. You’ll find she’ll understand.’</p>

<p>Emmeline heaved herself round and buried her
face in the pillow.</p>

<p>‘No, she won’t,’ she muttered. ‘Nobody could,
and besides, she never really cared for me. She’ll
hate me after this, I expect.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Emmeline, you mustn’t talk of your aunt
like that,’ said Mary gently. ‘She loves you all
dearly—I never knew how dearly till I saw her
this morning, tired to death with the journey and
all the worry and anxiety following so quick on
her grief at losing her friend, and yet comforting
poor little Micky as if she’d been his mother. Now
that it is all over, and I shall never misjudge
her so again, perhaps there’s no harm in telling
you that there was a time when I had my doubts
as to how your living with her would turn out,
what with her being so young and pretty, and
more used to a gay London life than to bringing
up children; but I’ve reproached myself many a
time this morning for ever having had such
uncharitable thoughts, for a better Christian or
a more loving-hearted young lady doesn’t walk
the earth.’</p>

<p>Poor dear Mary! She little thought that Emmeline
had all along been quite aware of those
misgivings of hers, which she had been too loyal
and good a woman ever to express in words, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that it is far easier to suggest doubts than to put
trust and confidence in their place. Emmeline
said nothing, but she none the less looked forward
with dread to the possible visit from Aunt Grace.
Even Mary thought she had done very wrong,
dear kind Mary, who always took the best view of
things, and as to Aunt Grace, she would never
really forgive her, or believe how very sorry
she was.</p>

<p>Emmeline’s heart sank when, about half an
hour afterwards, Aunt Grace herself arrived.
She was looking so ill and sad that a dreadful
fear came over Emmeline lest Micky might, after
all, have been sent to prison, and she could only
look at Aunt Grace in dumb suspense. Fortunately,
her aunt understood at once, and hastened
to set her mind at rest.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, Emmeline,’ she said; ‘Micky has
come out of the affair all right, and is quite
cleared of the charge of helping the other boy to
thieve. Micky stood up before the magistrate
like a little hero, and answered every question
so frankly and pluckily that no one could doubt
that he was telling the truth. Then it came to the
other boy’s turn, and though he whimpered, and
altogether did not cut nearly such a good figure
as Micky, he was quite ready to own that Micky
had known nothing of his meaning to pick the
lady’s pocket. I dare say poor Diamond Jubilee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
is a very naughty little boy, but I shall always
have a kindly feeling towards him, for being so
anxious as he certainly was to clear Micky’s
character. The end of it all was that Micky
was acquitted. I’m not altogether sorry he had
the fright, as a punishment for his naughtiness
in running away. As to the other poor
child, he was sentenced to have six strokes of the
birch.’</p>

<p>‘Then even <em>he</em> won’t be sent to prison?’ asked
Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, they would never think of sending
such a child to prison,’ Aunt Grace assured her.
‘You poor little Emmeline, I don’t wonder you
looked so white and frightened just now, if you
were expecting to hear of Micky’s being sent to
prison! But now your mind is easy about him, I
want you to tell me what’s been happening to <em>you</em>,
my poor child.’</p>

<p>Something in the unexpected gentleness of the
question brought the tears into Emmeline’s eyes
again. ‘Oh, Aunt Grace,’ she said, ‘I am so
very, very sorry!’</p>

<p>Aunt Grace bent over her suddenly, and gave
her one of her rare kisses. ‘I know you are,
darling,’ she said—she had never called Emmeline
‘darling’ before—‘tell me all about it. Of course
I know a good deal from what Micky has told me,
but I want to hear it from you too. Tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
from the very beginning. What made you first
think of adopting Diamond Jubilee?’</p>

<p>It was very odd; all the morning Emmeline
had been dreading more than anything else
having to tell her story to Aunt Grace, and
yet, now, almost before she knew what she was
doing, she found herself pouring it all out as
freely and fully as if Aunt Grace had been her
most intimate friend. She began by speaking
of the Meeting in the Village School, and of how
much it had made her want to do good to the poor.
Then came the history of the day they had
gone to the Fair alone—‘and I knew all the time
you wouldn’t like us to go alone, though I pretended
to myself that you wouldn’t mind,’ Emmeline
confessed—and of the encounter with Diamond
Jubilee, and of how it had almost seemed
‘meant’ that they should adopt him when his dire
need of being plucked as a brand from the burning
was brought home to them so forcibly.</p>

<p>‘I thought how b-beautiful it would be to bring
him up to be a m-missionary!’ said Emmeline,
with two little sobs at the remembrance of the
woeful way in which Diamond Jubilee had disappointed
her.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t have thought myself he was quite
cut out for a missionary,’ said Aunt Grace
gravely, though her eyes could not help twinkling
a little, ‘but go on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Emmeline went on to tell of all the plans
for Diamond Jubilee’s welfare, of the Feudal
Castle where he was to dwell, and the chocolate
and monkey-nuts on which he was to live, and of
all their plots and contrivances. Once or twice she
noticed that her listener looked away quickly, but
she did not pay much attention to this, and was
continuing her tale quite gravely and sorrowfully,
when all at once Aunt Grace broke into one
of those clear, ringing laughs which Emmeline
had been wont to consider so frivolous and
unsuitable for an aunt. For a moment Emmeline
stared at her, puzzled and half offended;
then suddenly it struck her for the first time that
the whole affair really was rather funny, and she
too laughed, though a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry, Emmeline,’ said Aunt Grace; ‘I
didn’t mean to laugh, but you raised such an
absurd picture in my mind that I simply couldn’t
help it!’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mind at all,’ said Emmeline, and it was
the truth, though a week ago she would have
been greatly displeased at anyone’s venturing to be
amused at her.</p>

<p>‘Well, go on with your story,’ said Aunt Grace,
and Emmeline began to relate the troubles and
adventures of yesterday. Aunt Grace listened so
sympathetically that it must be owned that her
niece quite enjoyed giving a graphic description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the past perils of Green Ginger Land and of
her horror at seeing Micky in the hands of the
policeman. It was only when she had come to
the end of her tale and Aunt Grace remained
silent that she remembered it had really been in
the nature of a confession.</p>

<p>‘Are you going to scold me, Aunt Grace?’ she
asked at the end, a little uneasily.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause before Aunt Grace
answered: ‘No, I don’t think I will scold you.
Of course, it was very wrong to adopt the child
without leave, but I think what has happened has
taught you just how wrong and foolish it was
better than anything I could say. And in itself
it was a good and beautiful thing to want to help
poor little Diamond Jubilee to a better life.’</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Then Emmeline
said timidly: ‘Do you know, Aunt Grace, I always
thought you didn’t care about such things.’</p>

<p>‘What made you think I didn’t?’ asked Aunt
Grace, who did not seem at all offended.</p>

<p>‘Because—because’—Emmeline stammered and
turned rather red, ‘you seemed almost to dislike
that wonderful little girl Mr. Faulkner told us
about—I mean the one who was so very good to
the poor children.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure she was a little prig,’ said Aunt Grace,
quickly, ‘and, anyhow, she wasn’t worthy of all the
fuss Mr. Faulkner was making about her. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
doesn’t follow, because I don’t think very much of
that particular little girl, that I don’t like other
little girls trying to do unselfish things, even if
they make mistakes sometimes, for I do’; and
once more she bent down and kissed Emmeline.
A sudden recollection stung Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t think nearly so well of me if you
knew everything,’ she blurted out; ‘there’s something
ever so much worse I was forgetting to tell
you. We had spent all our money that day we
went to the Fair, and—and I thought we might
use the extra money-box money to buy Diamond
Jubilee’s food with. You see we <em>had</em> collected it
for children like him.’ She broke off, not knowing
how to tell the rest.</p>

<p>‘You had collected it on the understanding that
it was for the Home, not to buy chocolates and
monkey-nuts for any ragged little boy you chanced
to come across,’ said Aunt Grace gently, ‘so I’m
afraid you’ll have to pay it back gradually out of
your pocket-money. By the way, did you buy
your railway ticket out of the extra money-box
fund?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, I borrowed that from the chickens’
money, and I did mean to pay it back next
Saturday. But that isn’t all I was going to tell
you’—she turned away her head—‘I as good as
told a story about the extra money-box money
afterwards’—her voice grew choky—‘Jane found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
out it was empty, like the prying old thing she is,
and said she was sure Alice had taken the money,
as she had been doing my room.’</p>

<p>‘And you didn’t tell her you’d taken it yourself?’
said Aunt Grace quietly, as Emmeline hid
her face in the pillow.</p>

<p>A stifled sound that could just be distinguished
as ‘No!’ came from the depths of the pillow.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m very sorry indeed about this,’ said
Aunt Grace, ‘far more sorry than about anything
else that’s happened. But I’m glad you’ve told
me. You’ll have to tell Jane as soon as you get
home.’</p>

<p>Emmeline hated the idea of telling Jane, but
she saw that it was the only honourable thing to
be done, and resolved to do it on the first possible
opportunity; a resolution which she bravely carried
out when the right time came.</p>

<p>That was all Aunt Grace said in the way of
reproof. For the rest of the visit she spoke
chiefly of Miss King, telling Emmeline about the
last few hours of her life as though she found
comfort in the child’s sympathy.</p>

<p>‘I can’t grieve very much,’ she said simply.
‘For years we had been dreading the end, and
when it really came she suffered so very little.
Of course, there must always be one’s selfish
sorrow at the loss, but I can’t feel she is at all
far off.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Aunt Grace went away,
and for the rest of the morning Emmeline was
left alone except for a short visit from the
Doctor. She did not feel at all dull or lonely,
however, for there seemed so much to think and
wonder over.</p>

<p>‘It’s very odd how different people are from
what you expect them to be,’ was the upshot of
her reflections. ‘Mary was dear and kind, as she
always is, but she didn’t understand a bit. It
was Aunt Grace who understood that adopting
Diamond Jubilee wasn’t <em>all</em> naughtiness. Well,
that plan’s been a great failure, and I don’t
suppose we shall ever see him again, but anyhow,
there’s one good thing come of it. If it
hadn’t been for Diamond Jubilee I might never
have known how good and nice Aunt Grace
really is!’</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">DIAMOND JUBILEE IS ADOPTED FOR THE
SECOND TIME</span></h2>

<p>Emmeline’s expectation that they would never
see Diamond Jubilee again was not fulfilled. They
saw him again only a week later.</p>

<p>During the interval, various things had been
happening in Paradise Court. The police had
long been on the look-out for a pretext to make a
raid on Mother Grimes’s premises, and the theft
of Emmeline’s watch gave them just the excuse
they wanted, for Bully Ben lived at the informal
little school kept by that lady, of whom he was an
old pupil. When the raid took place, they discovered
not only the watch, but so many other
stolen properties that Mother Grimes herself,
Bully Ben and several more of the older pupils
presently found themselves being lodged at His
Majesty’s expense for longer or shorter terms.
Emmeline’s watch was not directly responsible for
this, for the prisoners had been tried on other
charges of which there were plenty; so that she
had all the delight of its being restored to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
without the disagreeable experience of appearing
in the witness-box.</p>

<p>Bad though it was, Mother Grimes’s establishment
had been Diamond Jubilee’s only home,
and his probable fate now that it had been
broken up weighed much on Aunt Grace’s mind,
for something in the appearance of the forlorn
little street arab as he stood up to bear witness
to Micky’s innocence had touched her kind heart.
She said nothing as yet on the subject to any
of his former adopters, but simply arranged for
his coming to make a fortnight’s stay with a
respectable old woman in the village, who was
glad to eke out her slender earnings by receiving
little town children in need of a country holiday.</p>

<p>Diamond Jubilee arrived; a much pleasanter
Diamond Jubilee than he had been on his first
introduction to the children, for Aunt Grace had
provided for his going through a series of
carbolic acid baths, and had furnished him with a
sufficient stock of Micky’s old clothes to allow
of his former wardrobe being burnt. It is much
easier for a boy to have self-respect when his
outward appearance is neat, and Diamond
Jubilee’s language and manners improved very
decidedly. Of course, there were occasional outbreaks
when the ways of respectability bored him,
and less occasional lapses into the speech of Green
Ginger Land, but on the whole he was so docile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and well-behaved that Aunt Grace became more
unwilling than ever to let him go back to the
workhouse, far less to the old Paradise Court life.</p>

<p>He came to play or to go for walks with the
Bolton children most afternoons, and on these
occasions Aunt Grace always took care to be
present, much to his delight, for he had developed
a chivalrous devotion to her.</p>

<p>‘She’s a rare clever gal,’ he told Micky.</p>

<p>Perhaps Micky was more gratified by the
compliment than Aunt Grace felt in her turn
when Diamond Jubilee confided to her that
Micky would have been ‘a master one’ at Mother
Grimes’s trade, if only he had been brought up to
it—he was that quick and sharp!</p>

<p>All this time a certain plan was ripening in
Aunt Grace’s mind, and at last one tea-time she
mooted it to the children.</p>

<p>‘How would you like to adopt Diamond
Jubilee again?’ she suggested cheerfully.</p>

<p>‘Scrumptious!’ said Micky, with his mouth full
of bread and jam. ‘He’ll be champion at bowling
when I’ve trained him a little more.’</p>

<p>‘And Punch is getting quite fond of him. He
came and licked all over his face yesterday,’ put
Kitty.</p>

<p>Emmeline looked doubtful. It was all very
well having Diamond Jubilee for a fortnight’s
visit, but adopting him again was another matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’m afraid, Micky, it would hardly do to keep
him here, even to play cricket with you,’ said
Aunt Grace. ‘You see, he needs to be kept under
strict discipline. No, my idea is for you children
to send him to Mr. Faulkner’s Home. They’d
take him for fifteen pounds a year, and it would be
the making of him.’</p>

<p>‘Then shouldn’t we ever see him?’ said Kitty
dolefully.</p>

<p>‘What a beastly dull sort of adoption!’ exclaimed
Micky.</p>

<p>‘And where are the fifteen pounds to come
from?’ said Emmeline, ‘even with birthday
money and Christmas money put together we
don’t get nearly fifteen pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Aunt Grace slowly, ‘you know I
promised to get you a donkey and cart. If you
were willing to do without them, I’d give you
each five pounds a year instead, and you could
pay for Diamond Jubilee’s keep at the Home.
As to not seeing Diamond Jubilee, and its being
a dull sort of adoption, he could always come and
spend the summer holidays with us, you know,
and you would get letters from him in between-whiles
and hear a great deal about him from
Mr. Faulkner. But, after all, whether it’s dull
or interesting isn’t the question. The question
is whether you are willing to deny yourselves
a pleasure so as to give a poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
boy who has never had a chance yet the opportunity
of growing up into a good, useful man.
I don’t want to press you in any way, and I
don’t want you to settle anything in a hurry,
but talk it over quietly among yourselves and
tell me in a day or two what you think of the
plan.’</p>

<p>For the rest of the day the children were
rather silent and preoccupied. It was not nearly
so much fun adopting Diamond Jubilee in the
fashion Aunt Grace suggested as when his
presence in the neighbourhood had involved the
perils and delights of a plot; but they were
good children in the main, and Aunt Grace’s
suggestions had a way of sticking.</p>

<p>Emmeline came up to the schoolroom that
evening, when the twins were drinking their
supper-milk, and began fidgeting with the blind-tassel.
‘After all,’ she remarked abruptly, ‘I
suppose when you’ve once adopted a person you’re
rather bound to go on with it if you can, even if
it doesn’t turn out quite as beautiful and romantic
as you thought it would be.’</p>

<p>‘And dogs are awfully good judges of character,’
remarked Kitty thoughtfully. ‘Everybody
says so.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Micky gloomily, ‘I suppose it
doesn’t really much matter which sort of donkey
we get!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Emmeline,’ said Kitty, ‘you’ll wait to tell
Aunt Grace when we’re there, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Let’s all go downstairs again and tell her now!’
said Micky, more cheerfully. Micky would have
been reconciled to most things so long as they gave
him a good excuse for going downstairs again
after the doom of bedtime had been pronounced.</p>

<p class="tb">‘Well,’ remarked Mr. Faulkner, ‘things certainly
run in families.’ He had come to call one afternoon,
and found the whole party out except
Emmeline, who was staying in with a cold. They
had been discussing the re-adoption of Diamond
Jubilee.</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’ asked Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of your Aunt Grace,’ said
Mr. Faulkner, between two puffs of his pipe, ‘and
how <em>she</em> first took up practical philanthropy at the
mature age of twelve.’</p>

<p>‘Did she?’ asked Emmeline, rather vaguely.
Truth to tell, she did not feel quite certain what
practical philanthropy meant.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mr. Faulkner. ‘Don’t you remember
my speaking at the Meeting the other evening of
that little girl whose pocket-money was the very
first subscription to the Home, and who spent
most of her playtime trying to help the poor little
children of the slums? It was very stupid of me,
but it never struck me till your aunt seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
shy of its being spoken of that it might be the
same Miss Bolton.’</p>

<p>‘But that child’s name was Kathleen,’ said
Emmeline, looking very much puzzled.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know. It was really that which threw
me out, for I didn’t discover till the other day that
Miss Bolton’s second name is Kathleen, and that
she was always called by it until she grew up.’</p>

<p>A light had broken on Emmeline’s face. ‘Why,
to be sure!’ she exclaimed, ‘I remember now
mother telling me that Kitty was named after her.’</p>

<p>A short silence followed, during which Mr.
Faulkner puffed away at his pipe and dreamed
rose-coloured day-dreams which might or might
not come true, and Emmeline strove hard to grasp
this startling new idea. ‘I wonder when she gave
up that sort of thing,’ she remarked presently.</p>

<p>‘What sort of thing?’ asked Mr. Faulkner. He
had been growing rather absent just lately.</p>

<p>‘Looking after the poor, I mean, and—and all
that.’</p>

<p>‘Why, when she came to look after you instead,’
said Mr. Faulkner, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Then was it <em>that</em> she used to do when she
lived in London?’ asked Emmeline, on whom
all sorts of wonderful new lights were suddenly
dawning.</p>

<p>‘To be sure,’ said Mr. Faulkner. ‘What did
you think she was doing?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I thought she was going to dances and—dinner-parties,’
stammered Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘So she did sometimes,’ said Mr. Faulkner,
calmly; ‘it was at a dinner-party that I first met
her.’</p>

<p>The walkers came in a moment afterwards, and
the twins pounced on Mr. Faulkner with acclamation.
‘Mr. Faulkner, is it true that Diamond
Jubilee’s school reports will be sent to <em>us</em> just
like people’s reports are sent to their real parents?’
demanded Micky.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you’ll be duly informed twice a year of
the number of marks he gets for arithmetic and
what we think of his temper,’ Mr. Faulkner
assured him.</p>

<p>Micky bounded into the air. ‘I’m jolly glad
we settled on having him instead of the donkey!’
he announced.</p>

<p>‘I do wish we were going to see him all the
year round instead of only just at the summer
holidays,’ remarked Kitty. ‘I’m sure Punch will
miss him dreadfully. He always hates it when
people go away.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s a great castle in the air of mine that
some day things will work out so that you do see
him all the year round,’ said Mr. Faulkner, glancing
at Aunt Grace, who had turned rather rosier
than usual.</p>

<p>‘But that would only be if we lived in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
place as the Home and you,’ said Kitty, ‘and
that’s much too jolly ever to come true.’</p>

<p>‘Is it?’ said Mr. Faulkner smiling, and Aunt
Grace smiled too, though what the joke was, the
children could not imagine.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Grace,’ whispered Emmeline that evening
as she hugged her aunt good-night with her
uninjured arm, ‘I’ve found out to-day that I’m
the silliest goose that ever was, and I’m so awfully
glad!’</p>

<p>‘It seems rather an unusual subject for rejoicing!’
observed Aunt Grace.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m not rejoicing because I’ve been a
goose,’ Emmeline hastened to explain, ‘but because
I’ve just found out who that Kathleen Mr. Faulkner
told us about really was.’</p>

<p>‘That child was a little prig, Emmeline, as I’ve
told you before,’ said Aunt Grace smiling.</p>

<p>‘Well, anyhow she grew up into the delightfulest
aunt in the world!’ was Emmeline’s answer.</p>
